Foreword
When The Alchemist  was first published twentyfive years ago in my
native Brazil no one noticed A bookseller in the northeas t corner of
the country told me that only one person purchased a copy the first
week of its release It took another six months for the bookseller to
unload a second copyand  that was to the same person who
bought the first And who knows how long it took to sell the third
By the end of the year  it was clear to everyone that The Alchemist
wasnt working  My original publisher decided to cut me loose and
cancelled our contract They wiped their hands of the project and let
me take the book with me I was fortyone and desperate
But I never lost faith in the book or ever wavered in my vision
Why Because  it was me in there all of me heart and soul I was
living my own metaphor  A man sets out on a journey  dreaming of a
beautiful or magical place in pursuit of some unknown treasure At
the end of his journey  the man realizes the treasure was with him
the entire time I was following my Personal Legend and my
treasure was my capacity to write And I wanted to share this
treasure with the world
As I wrote in The Alchemist  when you want something the whole
universe conspires to help you I started knocking on the doors of
other publishers One opene d and the publisher on the other side
believed in me and my book and agreed to give The Alchemist  a
second chance Slowly  through word of mouth it finally started to
sellthree thousand then six thousand ten thousandbook by
book gradually throughout the year 
Eight months later an Americ an visiting Brazil picked up a copy of
The Alchemist  in a local book store He wanted to translate the book
and help me find a publish er in the United States HarperCollins
agreed to bring it to an American audience publishing it with great
fanfare ads in the New York Times  and influential news magazines

===== Page 9 =====
radio and television interview s But it still took some time to sell
slowly finding its audience in the United States by word  of mouth
just as it did in Brazil And then one day Bill Clinton was
photographed leaving the White House with a copy Then  Madonna
raved about the book to Vanity Fair and people from different walks
of life from Rush Limbaugh  and Will Smith to college students and
soccer momswere suddenly talking about it
The Alchemist  became a spontaneousand organic
Phenomenon The book hit the New York Times  bestse ller list an
important milestone for any author  and stayed there for more than
three hundred weeks It has since been translated into more than
eighty different languages the most translated book by any living
author  and is widely consid ered one of the ten best books of the
twentieth century 
People continue to ask me if I knew The Alchemist  would be such
a huge success The answer is no I had no idea How could I
When I sat down to write The Alchemist  all I knew is that I wanted to
write about my soul I wanted to write about my quest to find my
treasure I wanted to follow the omens because I knew even then
that the omens are the language of God
Though The Alchemist  is now celebrating its twentyfifth
anniversary  it is no relic of the past The book is still very much
alive Like my heart and like my soul it continues to live every day
because my heart and soul are in it And my heart and soul is your
heart and soul I am Santiago the shepherd boy in search of my
treasure just as you are Santiago the shepherd boy in search of
your own The story of one person is the story of everyon e and one
man s quest is the quest of all of humanity  which is why I believe
The Alchemist  continues all these years later to resonate with people
from different cultures all around the world touching them
emotionally and spiritually  equally  without prejudice
I reread The Alchemist  regularly and every time I do I experience
the same sensations I felt when I wrote it And here is what I feel I
feel happiness because it is all of me and all of you simultaneously 
I feel happine ss too because I know I can never be alone
Wherever I go people unde rstand me They understand  my soul
This continues to give me hope When I read about clash es around

am reminded that it is within our power to build a bridge to be

understand my story  then hes never too far from me It is always
within my power to build a bridge There is always a chance for
reconciliation a chance that one day he and I will sit around a table
together and put an end to our history of clashes And on this day  he
will tell me his story and I will tell him mine

Prologue
Translated by Clifford E Landers
The alchemist picked up a book that someone in the caravan had
brought Leafing through the pages he found a story about
Narcissus
The alchemist knew the legend of Narcissus a youth who knelt
daily beside a lake to contemplate his own beauty  He was so
fascinated by himself that one morning he fell into the lake and
drowned At the spot where he fell a flower was born which was
called the narcissus
But this was not how the author of the book ended the story 
He said that when Narcissus died the goddesses of the forest
appeared and found the lake which had been fresh water 
transformed into a lake of salty tears
Why do you weep the goddesses asked
I weep for Narcissus the lake replied
Ah it is no surprise that you weep for Narcissus they said for
though we always pursued  him in the forest you alone could
contemplate his beauty close at hand
But    was Narcissus beautiful the lake asked
Who better than you to know that the goddesses said in
wonder  After all it was by your banks that he knelt each day to
contemplate himself
The lake was silent for some time Finally  it said
I weep for Narcissus but I never noticed that Narcissus was
beautiful I weep because each time he knelt beside my banks I
could see in the depths of his eyes my own beauty reflected
What a lovely story  the alchemist thought

THE BOYS NAME WAS SANTIAGO DUSK was falling as the boy arrived
with his herd at an abandoned church The roof had fallen in long
ago and an enormous sycamore had grown on the spot where the
sacristy had once stood
He decided to spend the night there He saw to it that all the
sheep entered  through the ruined gate and then laid some planks
across it to prevent the flock from wandering away during the night
There were no wolves in the region but once an animal had strayed
during the night and the boy had had to spend the entire next day
searching for it
He swept the floor with his jacket and lay down using the book he
had just finishe d reading as a pillow  He told himself that he would
have to start reading thicker books they lasted longer  and made
more comfortable pillows
It was still dark when he awoke and looking up he could see the
stars through the halfdestroyed roof
I wanted to sleep a little longer he thought He had had the same
dream that night as a week ago and once again he had awakened
before it ended
He arose and taking up his crook began to awaken the sheep
that still slept He had noticed that as soon as he awoke most of his
animals also began to stir It was as if some mysterious energy
bound his life to that of the sheep with whom he had spent the past
two years leading them through the countryside in search of food
and water They are so used to me that they know my schedule he
muttered Thinking about that for a moment he realized that it could
be the other way around  that it was he who had become
accustomed to their schedule

===== Page 15 =====
But there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken
The boy prodd ed them one by one with his crook calling each by
name He had always believed that the sheep were able to
understand what he said So there were times when he read them
parts of his books that had made an impression on him or when he
would tell them of the loneliness or the happiness of a shepherd in
the fields Sometimes he would comment to them on the things he
had seen in the villages they passed
But for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one
thing the girl the daughter of a merchant who lived in the village
they would reach in about four days He had been to the village only
once the year before The merchant was the proprietor of a dry
goods shop and he always demanded that the sheep be sheared in
his presence so that he would not be cheated A friend had told the
boy about the shop and he had taken his sheep there
I need to sell some wool the boy told the merchant
The shop was busy and the man asked the shepherd to wait until
the afternoon So the boy sat on the steps of the shop and took a
book from his bag
I didnt know shepherds knew how to read said a girls voice
behind him
The girl was typical of the region of Andalusia with flowing black
hair and eyes that vaguely recalled the Moorish conquerors

===== Page 16 =====
Well usually I learn more from my sheep than from books he
answered During the two hours that they talked she told him she
was the merchant s daughter  and spoke of life in the village where
each day was like all the others The shepherd told her of the
Andalusian countryside and related the news from the other towns
where he had stopped It was a pleasant change from talking to his
sheep
How did you learn to read the girl asked at one point
Like everybody learns he said In school
Well if you know how to read why are you just a shepherd
The boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid
responding to her question  He was sure the girl would never
understand He went on telling stories about his travels and her
bright Moorish eyes went wide with fear and surprise As the time
passed the boy found himse lf wishing that the day would never end
that her father would stay busy and keep him waiting for three days
He recognized that he was feeling something he had never
experienced before the desire to live in one place foreve r With the
girl with the raven hair  his days would never be the same again
But finally the merchant appeared and asked the boy to shear
four sheep He paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come
back the following year 
And now it was only four days before he would be back in that same
village He was excited and at the same time uneasy maybe the girl
had already forgotten him Lots of shepherds passed through selling
their wool
It does nt matter  he said to his sheep I know other girls in other
places
But in his heart he knew that it did matter  And he knew that
shepherds like seamen and like traveling salesmen always found a
town where there was someone who could make them forget the
joys of carefree wandering
The day was dawning and the shepherd urged his shee p in the
direction of the sun They never have to make any decisions he

===== Page 17 =====
thought Maybe that s why they always stay close to me
The only things that concerned the sheep were food and water  As
long as the boy knew how to find the best pastures in Andalusia
they would be his friends Yes their days were all the same with the
seemingly endless hours between sunrise and dusk and they had
never read a book in their young lives and didnt understand when
the boy told them about the sights of the cities They were content
with just food and water  and in exchange they generous ly gave of
their wool their company  andonce in a whiletheir meat
If I became a monster today  and decided to kill them one by one
they would become aware only after most of the flock had been
slaughtered thought the boy They trust me and theyve forgotten
how to rely on their own instincts because I lead them to
nourishment
The boy was surprised at his thoughts Maybe the church with the
sycamore grow ing from within had been haunted It had caused him
to have the same dream for a second time and it was causing him to
feel anger toward his faithful companions He drank a bit from the
wine that remained from his dinner of the night before and he
gathered his jacket closer to his body  He knew that a few hours from
now with the sun at its zenith the heat would be so great that he
would not be able to lead his flock across the fields It was the time
of day when all of Spain slept during the summer  The heat lasted
until nightfall and all that time he had to carry his jacket But when
he thought to complain about the burden of its weight he
remembered that because he had the jacket he had withstood the
cold of the dawn
We have to be prepared for change he thought and he was
grateful for the jacket s weight and warmth
The jacket had a purpose and so did the boy His purpos e in life
was to travel and after two years of walking the Andalusian terrain
he knew  all the cities of the region He was planning on this visit to
explain to the girl how it was that a simple shepherd knew how to
read That he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen His
parents had wanted him to become a priest and thereby a source of
pride for a simple farm family  They worked hard just to have food
and water  like the sheep He had studied Latin Spanish and

===== Page 18 =====
theology  But ever since he had been a child he had wanted to know
the world and this was much more important to him than knowing
God and learn ing about man s sins One afternoon on a visit to his
family  he had summoned up the courage to tell his father that he
didnt want to become a priest That he wanted to travel
People from all over the world have passed through this village
son said his father  They come in search of new things but when
they leave they are basically the same people they were when they
arrived They climb the moun tain to see the castle and they wind up
thinking that the past was better than what we have now They have
blond hair or dark skin but basically theyre the same as the people
who live right here
But Id like to see the castles in the towns where they live the
boy explained
Those people  when they see our land say that they would like to
live here forever  his father continued
Well Id like to see their land and see how they live said his
son
The people who come here have a lot of money to spend so they
can afford to travel his father said Amongst us the only ones who
travel are the shepherds
Well then Ill be a shepherd
His father said no more The next day he gave his son a pouch
that held three ancient Spanish gold coins
I found these one day in the fields I wanted them to be a part of
your inheritance But use them to buy your flock Take to the fields
and someday youll learn that our countryside is the best and our
women are the most beautiful

===== Page 19 =====
And he gave the boy his blessing The boy could see in his
father s gaze a desire to be able himself to travel the worlda
desire that was still alive despite his father s having had to bury it
over dozens of years unde r the burden of struggling for water to
drink food to eat and the same place to sleep every night of his life
The horizon was tinged with red and suddenly the sun appeared
The boy thought back to that conversation with his father  and felt
happy he had already seen  many castles and met many women
but none the equal of the one who awaited him several days
hence He owned a jacket a book that he could trade for another 
and a flock of sheep But most important he was able every day to
live out his dream If he were to tire of the Andalusian fields he could
sell his sheep and go to sea By the time he had had enough of the
sea he would already have known other cities other women and
other chances to be happy  I couldnt have found God in the
seminary  he thought as he looked at the sunrise
Whenever he could he soug ht out a new road to travel He had
never been to that ruined church before in spite of having traveled
through those parts many times The world was huge and
inexhaustible he had only to allow his sheep to set the route for a
while and he would discover other interesting things The problem is
that they dont even realize that theyre walking a new road every
day They dont see that the fields are new and the seasons change
All they think about is food and water 
Maybe were all that way the boy mused Even meI havent
thought of other women since I met the merchant s daughter 
Looking at the sun he calculated that he would reach Tarifa before

===== Page 20 =====
midday  There he could exchange his book for a thicker one fill his
wine bottle shave and have a haircut he had to prepare himself for
his meeting with the girl and he didnt want to think about the
possibility that some other shepherd with a larger flock of sheep
had arrived there before him and asked for her hand
Its the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life
interesting he thought as he looked again at the position of the sun
and hurried his pace He had suddenly remembered that in Tarifa
there was an old woman who interpreted dreams
The old woman led the boy to a room at the back of her house it
was separated  from her living room by a curtain of colored beads
The room s furnishi ngs consisted of a table an image of the Sacred
Heart of Jesus and two chairs
The woman sat down and told him to be seated as well Then she
took both of his hands in hers and began quietly to pray 
It sounded like a Gypsy prayer  The boy had already had
experience on the road with Gypsies they also traveled but they
had no flocks of sheep People said that Gypsies spent their lives
tricking others It was also said that they had a pact with the devil
and that they kidnapped children and taking them away to their
mysterious camps made them their slaves As a child the boy had
always been frightened to death that he would be captured by
Gypsies and this childhood fear returned when the old woman took
his hands in hers
But she has the Sacred Heart of Jesus there he thought trying to
reassure hims elf He didnt want his hand to begin trembling
showing the old woman that he was fearful He recited an Our Father
silently 
Very interesting said the woman never taking her eyes from the
boys hands and then she fell silent
The boy was becoming nervous His hands began to tremble and
the woman sensed it He quickly pulled his hands away 
I didnt come here to have you read my palm he said already
regretting having come He thought for a moment that it would be

===== Page 21 =====
better to pay her fee and leave without learning a thing that he was
giving too much importance to his recurrent dream
You came so that you could learn about your dreams said the
old wom an And dreams are the language of God When he speaks
in our languag e I can interpret what he has said But if he speaks in
the language of the soul it is only you who can understand But
whichever it is Im going to charge you for the consultation
Another trick the boy though t But he decided to take a chance A
shepherd always takes his chances with wolves and with drought
and that s what makes a shepherd s life exciting
I have had the same dream twice he said I dreamed that I was
in a field with my sheep when a child appeared and began to play
with the anima ls I dont like people to do that because the sheep
are afraid of strangers But children always seem to be able to play
with them without frightening  them I dont know why I dont know
how animals know the age of human beings
Tell me more about your dream said the woman I have to get
back to my cooking and since you dont have much money  I cant
give you a lot of time
The child went on playing with my sheep for quite a while
continued the boy a bit upset And suddenly  the child took me by
both hands and transported me to the Egyptian pyramids
He paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the
Egyptian pyramids were But she said nothing
Then at the Egyptian pyramidshe said the last three words
slowly  so that the old woma n would understandthe child said to
me If you come here you will find a hidden treasure And just as
she was about to show me the exact location I woke up Both
times
The woman was silent for some time Then she again took his
hands and studied them carefully

===== Page 22 =====
Im not going to charge you anything now she said But I want
onetenth of the treasure if you find it
The boy laughedout of happiness He was going to be able to
save the little money he had because of a dream about hidden
treasure
Well interpret the dream he said
First swear to me Swear that you will give me onetenth  of your
treasure in exchange for what I am going to tell you
The shepherd swore that he would The old woman aske d him to
swear again while looking at the image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus
Its a dream in the language of the world she said I can
interpret it but the interpretat ion is very difficult Thats why I feel that
I deserve a part of what you find
And this is my interpretation you must go to the Pyramids in
Egypt I have never heard of them but if it was a child who showed
them to you they exist There you will find a treasure that will make
you a rich man
The boy was surprised and then irritated He didnt need  to seek
out the old woman for this But then he remembered that he wasnt
going to have to pay anything
I didnt need to waste my time just for this he said
I told you that your dream was a difficult one Its the simple
things in life that are the most extraordinary only wise men are able
to understand them And since I am not wise I have had to learn
other arts such as the reading of palms
Well how am I going to get to Egypt
I only interpret dreams I dont know how to turn them into reality 
That s why I have to live of f what my daughters provide me with
And what if I never get to Egypt
Then I dont get paid It wouldnt be the first time
And the woman told the boy to leave saying she had already
wasted too much time with him
So the boy was disappointe d he decided that he would never
again believe in dreams He remembered that he had a number of
things he had to take care of he went to the market for something to
eat he traded his book for one that was thicker  and he found a
bench in the plaza where he could sample the new wine he had

===== Page 23 =====
bought The day was hot and the wine was refreshing The sheep
were at the gates of the city in a stable that belonged to a friend
The boy knew a lot of people in the city That was what made
traveling appea l to himhe always made new friends and he didnt
need to spend  all of his time with them When someone  sees the
same people every day as had happened with him at the seminary 
they wind up becoming a part of that person s life And then they
want the person to change If someone isnt what others want them
to be the others become angry Everyone seems to have a clear
idea of how other people should lead their lives but none about his
or her own
He decided to wait until the sun had sunk a bit lower in the sky
before followin g his flock back through the fields Three days from
now he would be with the merchant s daughter 
He started to read the book he had bought On the very first page
it desc ribed a burial ceremony  And the names of the people
involved were very difficult to pronounce If he ever wrote a book he
thought he would present one person at a time so that the reader
wouldnt have to worry about memorizing a lot of names
When he was finally able to concentrate on what he was reading
he liked the book better the burial was on a snowy day and he
welcomed the feeling of being cold As he read on an old man sat
down at his side and tried to strike up a conversation
What are they doing the old man asked pointing at the people
in the plaza
Working the boy answered dryly making it look as if he wanted
to concentrate on his reading
Actually  he was thinking about shearing his sheep in front of the
merchant s daughter  so that she could see that he was someone
who was capable of doing difficult things He had already imagined
the scene many times every  time the girl became fascin ated when
he explained that the sheep had to be sheared from back to front He
also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared
the sheep Most of them he had read in books but he would tell
them as if they were from his personal experience She would never
know the dif ference because she didnt know how to read

===== Page 24 =====
Meanwhile the old man persisted in his attempt to strike up a
conversation He said that he was tired and thirsty  and asked if he
might have a sip of the boys wine The boy offered his bottle hoping
that the old man would leave him alone
But the old man wanted to talk and he asked the boy what book
he was reading The boy was tempted to be rude and move to
another bench  but his father  had taught him to be respectful of the
elderly  So he held out the book to the manfor two reasons first
that he himself wasnt sure how to pronounce the title and second
that if the old man didnt know how to read he would probably feel
ashamed and decide of his own accord to change benches
Hmm    said the old man looking at all sides of the book as if
it were some strange object This is an important book but its really
irritating
The boy was shocked The old man knew how to read and had
already read the book And if the book was irritating as the old man
had said the boy still had time to change it for another 
Its a book that says the same thing almost all the other books in
the world say continued the old man It describes people s inability
to choo se their own Personal Legends And it ends up saying that
everyone believes the world s greatest lie
What s the world s greatest lie the boy asked completely
surprised
Its this that at a certain point in our lives we lose control of
what s happen ing to us and our lives become controlled by fate
That s the world s greatest lie 
That s never happened to me the boy said They wanted me to
be a priest but I decided to become a shepherd
Much better  said the old man Because you really like to travel

===== Page 25 =====
He knew what I was thinking the boy said to himself The old
man meanwhi le was leafing through the book without seeming to
want to return it at all The boy noticed that the man s clothing was
strange He looked like an Arab which was not unusua l in those
parts Africa was only a few hours from Tarifa one had only to cross
the narrow straits by boat Arabs often appeared in the city shopping
and chanting their strange prayers several times a day 
Where are you from the boy asked
From many places
No one can be from many places the boy said Im a shepherd
and I have been to many places but I come from only one place
from a city near an ancient castle That s where I was born
Well then we could say that I was born in Salem
The boy didnt know where Salem was but he didnt want to ask
fearing that he would appear ignorant He looked at the people in the
plaza for a while they were coming and going and all of them
seemed to be very busy 
So what is Salem like he asked trying to get some sort of clue
Its like it always has been
No clue yet But he knew that Salem wasnt in Andalusia If it
were he would already have heard of it
And what do you do in Salem he insisted
What do I do in Salem The old man laughed Well Im the king
of Salem
People say strange things the boy thought Sometimes its better
to be with the sheep who dont say anything And better still to be
alone with ones books They tell their incredible stories at the time
when you want to hear them  But when youre talking to people they
say some things that are so strange that you dont know how to
continue the conversation
My name is Melchizedek said the old man How many sheep
do you have
Enough said the boy He could see that the old man wanted to
know more about his life
Well then weve got a probl em I cant help you if you feel youve
got enough sheep

===== Page 26 =====
The boy was getting irritated  He wasnt asking for help It was the
old man who had asked for a drink of his wine and had started the
conversation 
Give me my book the boy said I have to go and gather my
sheep and get going
Give me onetenth of your sheep said the old man and Ill tell
you how to find the hidden treasure
The boy remembered his dream and suddenly everything was
clear to him The old woman hadnt charged him anythin g but the
old manmaybe he was her husbandwas going to find a way to
get much more money in exchange for information about something
that didnt even exist The old man was probably a Gypsy  too
But before the boy could say anything the old man leaned over
picked up a stick and began to write in the sand of the plaza
Something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the
boy was momentarily blinded With a movement that was too quick
for someone his age the man covered whatever it was with his
cape When his vision returned to normal the boy was able to read
what the old man had written in the sand
There in the sand of the plaza of that small city the boy read the
names of his father and his mother and the name of the seminary he
had attended He read the name of the merchant s daughter  which
he hadnt even known and he read things he had never told anyone
Im the king of Salem the old man had said
Why would a king be talking with a shepherd the boy asked
awed and embarrassed
For several reasons But lets say that the most importan t is that
you have succeeded in discovering your Personal Legend
The boy didnt know what a person s Personal Legend was
Its what you have always wanted to accomplish Everyone when
they are young knows what their Personal Legend is
At that point in their lives everything is clear and everything is
possible They  are not afraid to dream and to yearn for everything
they would like to see happen to them in their lives But as time

===== Page 27 =====
passes a mysterious force begins to convince them that it will be
impossible for them to realize their Personal Legend
None of what the old man was saying made much sense to the
boy But he wanted to know  what the mysterious force was the
merchant s daughter would be impressed when he told her about
that
Its a force that appears to be negative but actually shows you
how to realize your Personal Legend It prepares your spirit and your
will because there is one great truth on this planet whoever you are
or what ever it is that you do when you really want something its
because that desire originate d in the soul of the universe Its your
mission on earth
Even when all you want to do is travel Or marry the daughter of
a textile merchant
Yes or even search for treasure The Soul of the World is
nourished by people s happiness And also by unhappiness envy
and jealousy  To realize ones Personal Legend is a person s only
real obligation All things are one
And when you want something all the universe conspires in
helping you to achieve it
They were both silent for a time observing the plaza and the
townspeople It was the old man who spoke first
Why do you tend a flock of sheep
Because I like to travel
The old man pointed to a baker standing in his shop window at
one corner of the plaza When he was a child that man wanted to
travel too But he decided first to buy his bakery and put some
money aside When hes an old man hes going to spend a month in
Africa He neve r realized that people are capable at any time in their
lives of doing what they dream of
He should have decided to become a shepherd the boy said
Well he thought about that the old man said But bakers are
more important people than shepherds Bakers have homes while
shepherds sleep out in the open Parents would rather see their
children marry bakers than shepherds
The boy felt a pang in his heart thinking about the merchant s
daughter  There was surely a baker in her town

===== Page 28 =====
The old man continued In the long run what people think about
shepherds and bakers becomes more important for them than their
own Personal Legends
The old man leafed through the book and fell to reading a page
he came to The boy waited and then interrupted the old man just as
he himself had been interrupted Why are you telling me all this
Because you are trying to realize your Personal Legend And you
are at the point where youre about to give it all up
And that s when you always appear on the scene
Not always in this way but I always appear in one form or
another  Some times I appear in the form of a solution or a good
idea At other times at a crucial moment I make it easie r for things
to happ en There are other things I do too but most of the time
people dont realize Ive done them
The old man related that the week before he had been forced to
appear before a miner  and had taken the form of a stone The miner
had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds For five years
he had been working a certain river and had examined hundreds of
thousands of stones looking for an emerald The miner was about to
give it all up right at the point when if he were to examine just one
more stonejust one more he would find his emerald Since the
miner had sacrificed everythi ng to his Personal Legend the old man
decided to become involved He transformed himself into a stone
that rolled up to the miner s foot The miner  with all the anger and
frustration of his five fruitless years picked up the stone and threw it
aside But he had thrown it with such force that it broke the stone it
fell upon and there embedded in the broken stone was the most
beautiful emerald in the world
People learn early in their lives what is their reason for being
said the old man with a certain bitterness Maybe thats why they
give up on it so early  too But that s the way it is
The boy reminded the old man that he had said something about
hidden treasure
Treasure is uncovered by the force of flowing water  and it is
buried by the same currents said the old man If you want to learn
about your own treasure you will have to give me onetenth of your
flock

===== Page 29 =====
What about onetenth of my treasure
The old man looked disappointed If you start out by promising
what you dont even have yet youll lose your desire to work toward
getting it 
The boy told him that he had already promised to give onetenth
of his treasure to the Gypsy 
Gypsies are experts at getting people to do that sighed the old
man In any case its good that youve learned that everything in life
has its price This is what the W arriors of the Light try to teach
The old man returned the book to the boy 
Tomorrow  at this same time bring me a tenth of your flock And I
will tell you how to find the hidden treasure Good afternoon
And he vanished around the corner of the plaza
The boy began  again to read his book but he was no longer able to
concentrate He was tense and upset because he knew that the old
man was right He went over to the bakery and bough t a loaf of
bread thinking  about whether or not he should tell the baker what
the old man had said about him Sometimes its better to leave
things as they are he thought to himself and decided to say nothing
If he were to say anything  the baker would spend three days
thinking about giving it all up even though he had gotten used to the
way things were The boy could certainly resist causing that kind of
anxiety for the baker  So he began to wander through the city and
found himself at the gates There was a small building there with a
window at which people bought tickets to Africa And he knew that
Egypt was in Africa
Can I help you asked the man behind the window 
Maybe tomorr ow said the boy moving away  If he sold just one
of his sheep hed have enough to get to the other shore of the strait
The idea frightened him
Another dreamer  said the ticket seller to his assistant watching
the boy walk away  He doesnt have enough money to travel
While standing  at the ticket window  the boy had rememb ered his
flock and decided he should go back to being a shepherd In two

===== Page 30 =====
years he had learned everything about shepherding he knew how to
shear sheep how to care for pregnant ewes and how to protect the
sheep from wolves He knew all the fields and pastures of Andalusia
And he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals
He decided to return to his friend s stable by the longest route
possible As he walked past the citys castle he interrupted his
return and climbed the stone ramp that led to the top of the wall
From there he could see Africa in the distance Someone  had once
told him that it was from there that the Moors had come to occupy
all of Spain
He could see almost the entire city from where he sat including
the plaza where he had talked with the old man Curse the moment I
met that old man he thought  He had come to the town only to find a
woman who could interpret his dream Neither the wom an nor the
old man was at all impresse d by the fact that he was a shepherd
They were solitary individuals  who no longer believed in things and
didnt understand that shepherds become attached to their sheep
He knew everything about each member of his flock he knew which
ones were lame which one was to give birth two months from now
and which were the laziest He knew how to shear them and how to
slaughter them If he ever decided to leave them they would suf fer
The wind began to pick up He knew that wind people called it the
levanter  becau se on it the Moors had come from the Levant at the
eastern end of the Mediterranean
The levanter increased in intensity  Here I am between my flock
and my treasure the boy thought He had to choose between
something he had become accustomed to and something he wanted
to have  There was also the merchant s daughter  but she wasnt as

===== Page 31 =====
important as his flock because she didnt depend on him Maybe
she didnt even remember him He was sure that it made no
difference to her on which day he appeared for her every day was
the same and when each day is the same as the next its because
people fail to recogniz e the good things that happen in their lives
every day that the sun rises
I left my father  my mother  and the town castle behind They have
gotten used to my being away and so have I The sheep will get
used to my not being there too the boy thought
From where he sat he could observe the plaza People continued
to come and go from the bakers shop A young couple sat on the
bench where he had talked with the old man and they kissed
That baker    he said to himself without comple ting the
thought The levanter was still getting stronger  and he felt its force
on his face That wind had brought the Moors yes but it had also
brought the smell of the desert and of veiled women It had brought
with it the sweat and the dreams of men who had once left to search
for the unknow n and for gold and adventureand for the Pyramids
The boy felt jealous of the freedom of the wind and saw that he
could have the same freedom  There was nothing to hold him back
except himself  The sheep the merchant s daughter  and the fields
of Andalusia were only steps along the way to his Personal Legend
The next day the boy met the old man at noon He brought six
sheep with him
Im surprised  the boy said My friend bought all the other sheep
immediately  He said that he had always dreamed of being a
shepherd and that it was a good omen
That s the way it always is said the old man Its called the
principle of favorability  When  you play cards the first time you are
almost sure to win Beginner s luck
Why is that
Because there  is a force that wants you to realize your Personal
Legend it whets your appetite with a taste of success
Then the old man began to inspect the sheep and he saw that
one was lame The boy explained that it wasnt important  since that
sheep was the most intellige nt of the flock and produced the most
wool

===== Page 32 =====
Where is the treasure he asked
Its in Egypt near the Pyramids
The boy was startled The old woman had said the same thing
But she hadnt charged him anything
In order to find the treasure you will have to follow the omens
God has prepared a path for everyone to follow  You just have to
read the omens that he left for you
Before the boy could reply  a butterfly appeared and fluttered
between him and the old man He remembered something his
grandfather had once told him that butterflies were a good omen
Like crickets and like grasshoppers like lizards and fourleaf
clovers
That s right said the old man able to read the boys thoughts
Just as your grandfather taught you These are good omens
The old man opened his cape and the boy was struck by what he
saw The old man wore a breastplate of heavy gold covered with
precious stone s The boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on
the previous day 
He really was a king He must be disguised to avoid encounters
with thieves
Take these said the old man holding out a white stone and a
black stone that had been embedded at the center of the
breastplate They are called Urim and Thummim The black signifies
yes and the white no When you are unable to read the omens
they will help you to do so Always ask an objective question
But if you can try to make your own decisions The treasure is at
the Pyramids that you already knew  But I had to insist on the
payment of six sheep because I helped you to make your decision
The boy put the stones in his pouch From then on he would
make his own decisions

===== Page 33 =====
Dont forget that everything you deal with is only one thing and
nothing else And dont forget the language of omens And above
all dont forget to follow your Personal Legend through to its
conclusion
But before I go I want to tell you a little story 
A certain shopkeeper sent his son to learn about the secret of
happiness from the wisest man in the world The lad wandered
through the desert for forty days and finally came upon a beautiful
castle high atop a mountain It was there that the wise man lived
Rather than finding a saintly  man though our hero on entering
the main room  of the castle saw a hive of activity tradesmen came
and went people were conversing in the corners a small orchestra
was playing soft music and there was a table covered with platters
of the most delicious food in that part of the world The wise man
conversed with everyone and the boy had to wait for two hours
before it was his turn to be given the man s attention
The wise man listened attentively to the boys explanation of why
he had come but told him that he didnt have time just then to
explain the secret of happiness He suggested that the boy look
around the palace and return in two hours
Meanwhile I want to ask you to do something said the wise
man handing the boy a teaspoon that held two drops of oil As you
wander around  carry this spoon with you without allowing the oil to
spill
The boy began climbing and descending the many stairways of
the palace keeping his eyes fixed on the spoon After two hours he
returned to the room where the wise man was
Well asked the wise man did you see the Persian tapestries
that are hanging in my dining hall Did you see the garden that it
took the master gardener ten years to create Did you notice the
beautiful parchments in my library
The boy was embarrassed and confessed that he had observed
nothing His only concern had been not to spill the oil that the wise
man had entrusted to him
Then go back and observe the marvels of my world said the
wise man Y ou cannot trust a man if you dont know his house

===== Page 34 =====
Relieved the boy picked up the spoon and returned to his
exploration of the palace this time observing all of the works of art
on the ceilings and the walls He saw the gardens the mountains all
around him the beauty of the flowers and the taste with which
everything had been selecte d Upon returning to the wise man he
related in detail everything he had seen
But where are the drops of oil I entrusted to you asked the wise
man
Looking down at the spoon he held the boy saw that the oil was
gone 
Well there is only one piece of advice I can give you said the
wisest of wise men The secret of happiness is to see all the
marvels of the world and never to forget the drops of oil on the
spoon
The shepherd said nothing He had understood the story  the old
king had told him A shepherd  may like to travel but he should never
forget about his sheep
The old man looked at the boy and with his hands held together 
made several strange gesture s over the boys head Then  taking his
sheep he walked away 
At the highest point in Tarifa there is an old fort built by the Moors
From atop its walls one can catch a glimpse of Africa Melchizedek
the king of Salem sat on the wall of the fort that afternoon and felt
the levanter blowing in his face The sheep fidgeted nearby  uneasy
with their new owner and excited by so much change All they
wanted was food and water 
Melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out of
the port He would never again see the boy just as he had never
seen Abraham again after having charged him his onetenth fee
That was his work

===== Page 35 =====
The gods should not have desires because they dont have
Personal Legends But the king of Salem hoped desperately that the
boy would be successful
Its too bad that hes quickly going to forget my name he thought
I should have repeated it for him Then when he spoke about me he
would say that I am Melchizedek the king of Salem
He looked to the skies feelin g a bit abashed and said I know its
the vanity of vanities as you said my Lord But an old king
sometimes has to take some pride in himself
How strange Africa is thought the boy 
He was sitting in a bar very much like the other bars he had seen
along the narro w streets of Tangier  Some men were smoking from a
gigantic pipe that they passed from one to the other  In just a few
hours he had seen men walking hand in hand women  with their
faces covered and priests that climbed to the tops of towers and
chantedas everyone about him went to their knees and placed
their foreheads on the ground
A practice of infidels he said to himself As a child in church he
had always looked at the image of Saint Santiago Matamo ros on his
white horse his sword unsheathed and figures such as these
kneeling at his feet The boy felt ill and terribly alone The infidels
had an evil look about them
Besides this in the rush of his travels he had forgotten a detail
just one detail  which could keep him from his treasure for a long
time only Arabic was spoken in this country 
The owner of the bar approached him and the boy pointed to a
drink that had been served at the next table It turned out to be a
bitter tea The boy preferred wine
But he didnt need to worry about that right now What he had to
be concerned about was his treasure and how he was going to go
about getting it The sale of his sheep had left him with enough
money in his pouch and the boy knew that in money there was
magic whoever has money is never really alone Before long
maybe in just a few days he would be at the Pyramids An old man

===== Page 36 =====
with a breastplate of gold wouldnt have lied just to acquire six
sheep
The old man had spoken about signs and omens and as the boy
was crossing the strait he had thought about omens Yes the old
man had know n what he was talking about during the time the boy
had spent in the fields of Andalusia he had become used to learning
which path he should take by observing the ground and the sky He
had discovered that the presence of a certain bird meant that a
snake was nearby  and that a certain shrub was a sign that there
was water in the area The sheep had taught him that
If God leads the sheep so well he will also lead a man he
thought and that made him feel better  The tea seemed less bitter 
Who are you he heard a voice ask him in Spanish
The boy was relieved He was thinking about omens and
someone had appeared
How come you speak Spanish he asked The new arrival was a
young man in Western dress but the color of his skin suggested he
was from this city He was about the same age and height as the
boy
Almost everyone here speaks Spanish Were only two hours
from Spain
Sit down and let me treat you to something said the boy And
ask for a glass of wine for me I hate this tea
There is no wine in this country  the young man said The
religion here forbids it
The boy told him then that he needed to get to the Pyramids He
almost began to tell about his treasure but decided not to do so If
he did it was possible that the Arab would want a part of it as
payment for taking him there  He remembered what the old man had
said about of fering something you didnt even have yet
Id like you to take me there if you can I can pay you to serve as
my guide 
Do you have any idea how to get there the newcomer asked
The boy notice d that the owner of the bar stood nearby  listening
attentively to their conversation He felt uneasy at the man s
presence But he had found a guide and didnt want to miss out on
an opportunity

===== Page 37 =====
You have to cross the entire Sahara desert said the young man
And to do that you need money  I need to know whethe r you have
enough
The boy thoug ht it a strange  question But he trusted in the old
man who had said that when you really want something the
universe always conspires in your favor 
He took his money from his pouch and showed it to the young
man The owner of the bar came over and looked as well The two
men exchanged some words  in Arabic and the bar owner seemed
irritated
Lets get out of here said the new arrival He wants us to
leave
The boy was relieved He got up to pay the bill but the owner
grabbed him and began to speak to him in an angry stream of words
The boy was strong and wanted to retaliate but he was in a foreign
country  His new friend pushed the owner aside and pulled the boy
outside with him He wanted your money  he said Tangier is not
like the rest of Africa This is a port and every port has its thieves
The boy trusted his new friend He had helped him out in a
dangerous situation He took out his money and counted it
We could get to the Pyramids by tomorrow  said the other  taking
the money  But I have to buy two camels
They walked together through the narrow streets of Tangier 
Everywhere there were stalls with items for sale They reached the
center of a large plaza where the market was held There were
thousands of people there arguing selling and buying vegetables
for sale amongst daggers and carpets displayed alongside tobacco
But the boy never took his eye off his new friend After all he had all
his money  He thought about asking him to give it back but decided
that would be unfriendly  He knew nothing about the customs of the
strange land he was in
Ill just watch him he said to himself He knew he was stronger
than his friend
Suddenly  there in the midst of all that confusion he saw the most
beautiful sword he had ever seen The scabbard was embossed in
silver  and the handle was black and encrusted with precious stones

===== Page 38 =====
The boy promised himself that when he returned from Egypt he
would buy that sword 
Ask the owner of that stall how much the sword costs he said to
his friend Then he realized that he had been distracted for a few
moments looking at the sword His heart squeezed as if his chest
had suddenly compressed it He was afraid to look around because
he knew  what he would find He continued to look at the beautiful
sword for a bit longer  until he summoned the courage to turn
around
All around him was the market with people coming and going
shouting and buying and the aroma of strange foods    but
nowhere could he find his new companion
The boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become
separated from him by accident He decided to stay right there and
await his return As he waited a priest climbed to the top of a nearby
tower and began his chant everyone in the market fell to their
knees touched  their foreheads to the ground and took up the chant
Then like a colony of worke r ants they dismantled their stalls and
left
The sun began its departure as well The boy watched it through
its trajectory for some time until it was hidden behind  the white
houses surrounding the plaza He recalled that when the sun had
risen that morning he was on another continent still a shepherd with
sixty sheep and looking forward to meeting with a girl That morning
he had known  everything that was going to happen to him as he
walked through the familiar fields But now as the sun began to set
he was in a different country  a stranger in a strange land where he
couldnt even speak the language He was no longer a shepherd
and he had nothing not even the money to return and start
everything over 
All this happen ed between sunrise and sunset the boy thought
He was feeling  sorry for himself and lamenting the fact that his life
could have changed so suddenly and so drastically

===== Page 39 =====
He was so ashamed that he wanted to cry He had never even
wept in front of his own sheep But the marketplace was empty  and
he was far from home so he wept He wept because God was
unfair  and because this was the way God repaid those who believed
in their dreams
When I had my sheep I was happy  and I made those around me
happy  People saw me coming and welcomed me he thought But
now Im sad and alone Im going to become bitter and distrustful of
people because one person  betrayed me Im going to hate those
who have found their treasur e because I never found mine And Im
going to hold on to what little I have because Im too insignificant to
conquer the world 
He opened his pouch to see what was left of his possessions
maybe there was a bit left of the sandwich he had eaten on the ship
But all he found was the heavy book his jacket and the two stones
the old man had given him
As he looked at the stones he felt relieved for some reason He
had exchange d six sheep for two precious stones that had been
taken from a gold breastplat e He could sell the stones and buy a
return ticket But this time Ill be smarter  the boy thought removing
them from the pouch so he could put them in his pocket This was a
port town and the only truthf ul thing his friend had told him was that
port towns are full of thieves
Now he unders tood why the owner of the bar had been so upset
he was trying to tell him not to trust that man Im like everyone else
I see the world in terms of what I would like to see happen not
what actually does
He ran his fingers slowly over the stones sensing their
temperature and feeling their surfaces They were his treasure Just

===== Page 40 =====
handling them made him feel better  They reminded him of the old
man
When you want something all the universe conspires in helping
you to achieve it he had said
The boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man
had said There he was in the empty marketplace without a cent to
his name and with not a sheep to guard through the night But the
stones were proof that he had met with a kinga king who knew of
the boy s past
Theyre called Urim and Thummim and they can help you to read
the omens The boy put the stones back in the pouch and decided
to do an experiment The old man had said to ask very clear
questions and to do that the boy had to know what he wanted So
he asked if the old man s blessing was still with him
He took out one of the stones It was yes
Am I going to find my treasure he asked
He stuck his hand into the pouch and felt around for one of the
stones As he did so both of them pushed through a hole in the
pouch and fell to the ground  The boy had never even noticed that
there was a hole in his pouch He knelt down to find Urim and
Thummim and put them back in the pouch But as he saw them lying
there on the ground another phrase came to his mind
Learn to recognize omens and follow them the old king had
said
An omen The boy smiled to himself He picked up the two stones
and put them back in his pouch He didnt consider mending the hole
the stones could fall through any time they wanted He had
learned that there were certa in things one shouldnt ask about so as
not to flee from ones own Personal Legend I promised that I would
make my own decisions he said to himself 
But the stones  had told him that the old man was still with him
and that made him feel more confident He looked around at the
empty plaza again feeling less desperate than before This wasnt a
strange place it was a new one
After all what he had always wanted was just that to know new
places Even if he never got to the Pyramids he had already
traveled farther than any shepherd he knew  Oh if they only knew

===== Page 41 =====
how different things are just two hours by ship from where they are
he thought Although his new world at the moment was just an empty
marketplace he had already  seen it when it was teeming with life
and he would never forget it He remembered the sword It hurt him
a bit to think about it but he had never seen one like it before As he
mused about these things  he realized that he had to choose
between thinking of himself as the poor victim of a thief and as an
adventurer in quest of his treasure
Im an adventurer  looking for treasure he said to himself
He was shaken into wakefulness by someone He had fallen asleep
in the middle of the marketplace and life in the plaza was about to
resume
Looking around he sought his sheep and then realized that he
was in a new world But instead of being saddened he was happy 
He no longer had to seek out food and water for the sheep  he could
go in search of his treasure instead He had not a cent in his pocket
but he had faith He had decided the night before that he would be
as much an adventurer as the ones he had admired in books
He walked slowly through the market The merchants were
assembling their stalls and the boy helped a candy seller to do his
The candy seller had a smile on his face he was happy  aware of
what his life was about and ready to begin a days work His smile
reminded the boy of the old manthe mysterious old king he had
met This candy merchant isnt making candy so that later he can
travel or marry a shopkeeper s daughter  Hes doing it because its
what he wants to do thought the boy He realized that he could do
the same thing the old man had donesense whether a person was
near to or far from his Personal Legend Just by looking at them Its
easy and yet Ive never done it before he thought
When the stall was assembled the candy seller offered the boy
the first sweet he had made for the day The boy thanked him ate it
and went on his way When he had gone only a short distance he
realized that while they were erecting the stall one of them had
spoken Arabic and the other Spanish

===== Page 42 =====
And they had understood each other perfectly well 
There must be a language that doesnt depend on words the boy
thought Ive already had that experience with my sheep and now
its happening with people
He was learning a lot of new things Some of them were things
that he had already experienced and werent really new but that he
had never perceived before And he hadnt perceived them because
he had becom e accustomed  to them He realized If I can learn to
understand this language without words I can learn to understand
the world
Relaxed and unhurried he resolved that he would walk through
the narrow streets of Tangier  Only in that way would he be able to
read the omens He knew it would require a lot of patience but
shepherds know all about patience Once again he saw that in that
strange land he was applying  the same lessons he had learned with
his sheep
All things are one the old man had said
The crystal merchant awoke with the day and felt the same anxiety
that he felt every morning He had been in the same place for thirty
years a shop at the top of a hilly street where few customers
passed Now it was too late to change anythingthe only thing he
had ever learned to do was to buy and sell crystal glassware There
had been a time when many people knew of his shop Arab
merchants French and English geologists German soldiers who
were always wellheeled In those days it had been wond erful to be
selling crystal and he had thought how he would become rich and
have beautiful women at his side as he grew older 
But as time passed Tangier had changed The nearby city of
Ceuta had grown faster than Tangier  and business had fallen off
Neighbors moved away  and there remained only a few small shops
on the hill And no one was going to climb the hill just to browse
through a few small shops
But the crystal merchant had no choice He had lived thirty years
of his life buying and selling crystal pieces and now it was too late to

===== Page 43 =====
do anything else
He spen t the entire morning observing the infrequent comings and
goings in the street He had done this for years and knew the
schedule of everyone who passed But just before lunchtime a boy
stopped in front of the shop He was dressed normally  but the
practiced eyes  of the crystal merchant could see that the boy had no
money to spend Nevertheless the merchant decided to delay his
lunch for a few minutes until the boy moved on
A card hanging in the doorw ay announced that several languages
were spoken in the shop The boy saw a man appear behind the
counter 
I can clean up those glasses in the window  if you want said the
boy The way they look now  nobody is going to want to buy them
The man looked at him without responding
In exchange you could give me something to eat
The man still said nothing and the boy sensed that he was going
to have to make a decision In his pouch he had his jackethe
certainly wasn t going to need it in the desert Taking the jacket out
he began to clean the glasses In half an hour  he had cleaned all the
glasses in the window  and as he was doing so two customers had
entered the shop and bought some crystal
When he had completed the cleaning he asked the man for
something to eat Lets go and have some lunch said the crystal
merchant
He put a sign on the door and they went to a small caf nearby 
As they sat down at the only table in the place the crysta l merchant
laughed

===== Page 44 =====
You didnt have to do any cleaning he said The Koran requires
me to feed a hungry person
Well then why did you let me do it the boy asked
Because the crystal was dirty And both you and I needed to
cleanse our minds of negative thoughts
When they had eaten the merchant turned to the boy and said
Id like you to work in my shop Two customers came in today while
you were working and that s a good omen
People talk a lot about omens thought the shepherd But they
really dont know what theyr e saying Just as I hadnt realized that
for so many years I had been  speaking a language without words to
my sheep
Do you want to go to work for me the merchant asked
I can work for the rest of today  the boy answered Ill work all
night until dawn and Ill clean every piece of crystal in your shop In
return I need money to get to Egypt tomorrow 
The merchant laughed Even if you cleaned my crystal for an
entire year    even if you earned a good commission selling every
piece you would still have to borrow money to get to Egypt There
are thousands of kilometers of desert between here and there
There was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the
city was asleep No sound from the bazaars no arguments among
the merchants no men climbing to the towers to chant No hope no
adventure no old kings or Personal Legends no treasu re and no
Pyramids It was as if the world had fallen silent because the boys
soul had He sat there staring blankly through the door of the caf
wishing that he had died and that everything would end forever at
that moment 
The merchant looked anxious ly at the boy All the joy he had seen
that morning had suddenly disappeared
I can give you the money you need to get back to your country 
my son said the crystal merchant
The boy said nothing He got up adjusted his clothing and picked
up his pouch
Ill work for you he said
And after another long silence he added I need mone y to buy
some sheep

THE BOY HAD BEEN WORKING FOR THE crystal  merchant for almost a
month and he could see that it wasnt exactly the kind of job that
would make him happy  The merchant spent the entire day
mumbling behind the counte r telling the boy to be careful with the
pieces and not to break anything
But he stayed with the job because the merchant although he
was an old grouch treated him fairly the boy receive d a good
commission for each piece he sold and had already been able to put
some money aside That morning he had done some calculating if
he continued to work every day as he had been he would need a
whole year to be able to buy some sheep
Id like to build a display case for the crystal the boy said to the
merchant We could place it outside and attract those people who
pass at the bottom of the hill
Ive never had one before the merchant answered People will
pass by and bump into it and pieces will be broken
Well when I took my shee p through the fields some of them
might have died if we had come upon a snake But thats the way life
is with sheep and with shepherds 
The merchant  turned to a customer who wanted three crystal
glasses He was selling better than ever    as if time had turned
back to the old days when the street had been one of Tangier s
major attractions
Business has really improv ed he said to the boy after the
customer had left Im doing much better  and soon youll  be able to
return to your sheep Why ask more out of life
Because we have to respo nd to omens the boy said almost
without meanin g to then he regretted what he had said because the

===== Page 47 =====
merchant had never met the king
Its called the principle of favorability  beginner s luck Because
life wants you to achieve your Personal Legend the old king had
said
But the merchant understoo d what the boy had said The boys
very presence in the shop was an omen and as time passed and
money was pouring into the cash drawer  he had no regrets about
having hired the boy The boy was being paid more money than he
deserved because the merchant thinking that sales wouldnt
amount to much had offered the boy a high commissio n rate He
had assumed he would soon return to his sheep
Why did you want to get to the Pyramids he asked to get away
from the business of the display 
Because Ive always heard about them the boy answered
saying nothing about his dream The treasure was now nothing but a
painful memory  and he tried to avoid thinking about it
I dont  know anyone around here who would want to cross the
desert just to see the Pyramids said the merchant Theyre just a
pile of stones Y ou could build one in your backyard
Youve never had dreams of travel said the boy turning to wait
on a customer who had entered the shop
Two days later  the merchant spoke to the boy about the display 
I dont much like change he said You and I arent like Hassan
that rich merchant If he makes a buying mistake it doesnt affect
him much But we two have to live with our mistakes
That s true enough the boy thought ruefully 
Why did you think we should have the display
I want to get back to my sheep faster  We have to take advantage
when luck is on our side and do as much to help it as its doing to
help us It s called the principle of favorability  Or beginner s luck
The merchant was silent for a few moments Then he said The
Prophet gave us the Koran and left us just five obligations to satisfy
during our lives The most important is to believe only in the one true
God The others are to pray five times a day fast during Ramadan
and be charitable to the poor 
He stopped there His eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the
Prophet He was a devout man and even with all his impatience he

===== Page 48 =====
wanted to live his life in accordance with Muslim law 
What s the fifth obligation the boy asked
Two days ago you said that I had never dreamed of travel the
merchant answered The fifth obligation of every Muslim is a
pilgrimage We are obliged at least once in our lives to visit the holy
city of Mecca
Mecca is a lot farther away than the Pyramids When I was
young all I wanted to do was put together enough money to start
this shop I thought that someday Id be rich and could go to Mecca
I began to make some money  but I could never bring myself to leave
someone in charge of the shop the crystals are delicate  things At
the same time people were passing my shop all the time heading
for Mecca Some of them were rich pilgrims traveling in caravans
with servants and camels but most of the people making the
pilgrimage were poorer than I
All who went there were happy at having done so They placed
the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses One of
them a cobble r who made his living mending boots said that he had
traveled for almost a year through the desert but that he got more
tired when he had to walk through the streets of Tangier buying his
leather 
Well why dont you go to Mecca now asked the boy 
Because its the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive That s
what helps me face these days that are all the same these mute
crystals on the shelves and lunch and dinner at that same horrible
caf Im afraid that if my dream is realized Ill have no reason to go
on living
You dream about your sheep and the Pyramids but youre
different from me because you want to realize your dreams I just
want to dream about Mecca Ive already imagined a thousand times
crossing the desert arriving at the Plaza of the Sacred Stone the
seven times I walk around it before allowing myself to touch it Ive
already imagin ed the people who would be at my side and those in
front of me and the conversations and prayers we would share But
Im afraid that it would all be a disappointment so I prefer just to
dream about it

===== Page 49 =====
That day the merchant gave the boy permission to build the
display  Not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same
way
Two more months passed and the shelf brought many customers
into the crysta l shop The boy estimated that if he worked for six
more months he could return to Spain and buy sixty sheep and yet
another sixty In less than a year he would have doubled his flock
and he would be able to do business with the Arabs because he
was now able to speak their strange language Since that morning in
the marketplace he had never again made use of Urim and
Thummim because Egypt was now just as distant a dream for him
as was Mecca for the merchant Anyway  the boy had become happy
in his work and thought all the time about the day when  he would
disembark at T arifa as a winner 
You must always know what it is that you want the old king had
said The boy knew  and was now working toward it Maybe it was
his treasure to have wound up in that strange land met up with a
thief and doubled the size of his flock without spending a cent
He was proud of himself He had learned some important things
like how to deal in crystal and about the language without words   
and about omens One afternoon he had seen a man at the top of
the hill complaining that it was impossible to find a decent place to
get something to drink after such a climb The boy accustomed to
recognizing omens spoke to the merchant
Lets sell tea to the people who climb the hill
Lots of places sell tea around here the merchant said
But we could sell tea in crystal glasses The people will enjoy the
tea and want to buy the glasses I have been told that beauty is the
great seducer of men
The merchant didnt respond but that afternoon after saying his
prayers and closing the shop he invited the boy to sit with him and
share his hookah that strange pipe used by the Arabs

===== Page 50 =====
What is it youre looking for asked the old merchant
Ive already told you I need to buy my sheep back so I have to
earn the money to do so
The merchant put some new coals in the hookah and inhaled
deeply 
Ive had this shop for thirty years I know good crystal from bad
and everything else there is to know about crystal I know its
dimensions and how it behaves If we serve tea in crystal the shop
is going to expand And then Ill have to change my way of life
Well isnt that good
Im already used to the way things are Before you came I was
thinking about how much time I had wasted in the same place while
my friends had moved on and either went bankrupt or did better
than they had before It made me very depressed Now I can see
that it hasnt been too bad The shop is exactly the size I always
wanted it to be I dont want to change anything because I dont
know how to deal with change Im used to the way I am 
The boy didnt know what to say The old man continue d You
have been a real blessing to me Today  I understand something I
didnt see before every blessing ignored becomes a curse I dont
want anything else in life But you are forcing me to look at wealth
and at horizons  I have never known Now that I have seen them and
now that I see how immense my possibilities are Im going to feel
worse than I did before you arrived Because I know the things I
should be able to accomplish and I dont want to do so
Its good I refrained from saying anything to the baker in Tarifa
thought the boy to himself

===== Page 51 =====
They went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to
set They were conversing in Arabic and the boy was proud of
himself for being able to do so There had been a time when he
thought that his sheep could teach him everything he needed to
know about the world But they could never have taught him Arabic
There are probably other things in the world that the sheep cant
teach me thought the boy as he regarded the old mercha nt All they
ever do really  is look for food and water  And maybe it wasnt that
they were teaching me but that I was learning from them
Maktub  the merchant said finally 
What does that mean
You would have to have been born an Arab to understand he
answered But in your language it would be something like It is
written
And as he smothered the coals in the hookah he told the boy
that he could begin to sell tea in the crystal glasses Sometimes
there s just no way to hold back the river 
The men climb ed the hill and they were tired when they reached the
top But there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing mint
tea They went in to drink the tea which was served in beautiful
crystal glasses
My wife never thought of this said one and he boug ht some
crystalhe was entertaining guests that night and the guests would
be impressed by the beauty of the glassware The other man
remarked that tea was alway s more delicious when it was served in
crystal becaus e the aroma was retained The third said that it was a
tradition in the Orient to use crystal glasses for tea because it had
magical powers
Before long the news spread and a great many people began to
climb the hill to see the shop that was doing something new in a
trade that was so old Other shops were opened that served tea in
crystal but they werent at the top of a hill and they had little
business

===== Page 52 =====
Eventually  the merchant had to hire two more employees He
began to import enormous quantities of tea along with his crystal
and his shop was sought out by men and women with a thirst for
things new 
And in that way  the months passed
The boy awoke before dawn  It had been eleven month s and nine
days since he had first set foot on the African continent
He dressed in his Arabian clothing of white linen bought
especially for this day He put his headcloth in place and secured it
with a ring made of camel skin Wearing his new sandals he
descended the stairs silently 
The city was still sleeping He prepared himself a sandwich and
drank some hot tea from a crystal glass Then he sat in the sunfilled
doorway  smoking the hookah
He smoked in silence think ing of nothing and listening to the
sound of the wind that brought the scent of the desert When he had
finished his smoke he reache d into one of his pockets and sat there
for a few moments regarding what he had withdrawn 
It was a bundl e of money  Enough to buy himself a hund red and
twenty sheep a return ticket  and a license to import products from
Africa into his own country 
He waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the
shop Then the two went of f to have some more tea
Im leaving today  said the boy I have the money I need to buy
my sheep And you have the money you need to go to Mecca
The old man said nothing
Will you give me your blessing asked the boy You have
helped me The man contin ued to prepare his tea sayin g nothing
Then he turned to the boy 
I am proud of you he said You brought a new feeling into my
crystal shop But you know that Im not going to go to Mecca Just as
you know that youre not going to buy your sheep
Who told you that asked the boy  startled
Maktub  said the old crystal merchant

===== Page 53 =====
And he gave the boy his blessing
The boy went to his room and packed his belongings They filled
three sacks As he was leaving he saw in the corner of the room
his old shephe rds pouch It was bunched up and he had hardly
thought of it for a long time As he took his jacket out of the pouch
thinking to give it to someone in the street the two stones fell to the
floor Urim and Thummim
It made  the boy think of the old king and it startled him to realize
how long it had been since he had thought of him For nearly a year
he had been working incessantly  thinking only of putting aside
enough money so that he could return to Spain with pride
Never stop dreaming the old king had said Follow the omens
The boy picked up Urim and Thummim and once again had the
strange sensat ion that the old king was nearby  He had worked hard
for a year  and the omens were that it was time to go
Im going to go back to doing just what I did before the boy
thought Even though the sheep didnt teach me to speak Arabic
But the sheep  had taught him something even more important
that there was a language in the world that everyone understood a
language the boy had used throughout the time that he was trying to
improve things at the shop It was the language of enthusiasm of
things accomp lished with love and purpose and as part of a search
for something believed in and desired Tangier was no longer a
strange city and he felt that just as he had conquered this place he
could conquer the world 
When you want something all the universe conspires to help you
achieve it the old king had said

===== Page 54 =====
But the old king hadnt said anything about being robbed or about
endless deserts or about people who know what their dreams are
but dont want to realize them The old king hadnt told him that the
Pyramids were just a pile of stones or that anyone could build one in
his backyard And he had forgotten to mention that when you have
enough money to buy a flock larger than the one you had before
you should buy it
The boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things He
went down the stairs and found the merchant waiting on a foreign
couple while two other customers walked about the shop drinking
tea from crystal glasses It was more activity than usual for this time
of the morning  From where he stood he saw for the first time that
the old merchant s hair was very much like the hair of the old king
He remembere d the smile of the candy seller  on his first day in
Tangier  when he had nothing to eat and nowhere to gothat smile
had also been like the old king s smile
Its almost as if he had been  here and left his mark he thought
And yet none of these people has ever met the old king On the
other hand he said that he always appeared to help those who are
trying to realize their Personal Legend 
He left without saying goodbye to the crystal merchant He didnt
want to cry with the other people there He was going to miss the
place and all the good things he had learned He was more confident
in himself though and felt as though he could conquer the world
But Im going back to the fields that I know  to take care of my
flock again He said that to himself with certainty  but he was no
longer happy with his decision He had worked for an entire year to
make a dream come true and that dream minute by minute was
becoming less important Maybe because that wasnt really his
dream
Who knows    maybe its better to be like the crystal merchant
never go to Mecca and just go through life wanting to do so he
thought again trying to convince himself But as he held Urim and
Thummim in his hand they had transmitted to him the strength and
will of the old king By coincidenceor maybe it was an omen the
boy thoughthe came to the bar he had entered on his first day

===== Page 55 =====
there The thief wasnt there and the owner brought him a cup of
tea
I can always go back to being a shepherd the boy thought I
learned how to care for sheep and I havent forgotten how thats
done But maybe Ill never  have another chance to get to the
Pyramids in Egyp t The old man wore a breastplate of gold and he
knew about my past He really was a king a wise king
The hills of Andalusia were only two hours away  but there was an
entire desert between him and the Pyramids Yet the boy felt that
there was another way to regard his situation he was actually two
hours closer to his treasure    the fact that the two hours had
stretched into an entire year didnt matter 
I know why I want to get back to my flock he thought I
understand sheep theyre no longer a problem and they can be
good friends On the other hand I dont know if the desert can be a
friend and its in the desert that I have to search for my treasure If I
dont find it I can always go home I finally have enough money  and
all the time I need Why not
He suddenly felt tremendously happy  He could always go back to
being a shepherd He could always become a crystal salesman
again Maybe the world had other hidden treasures but he had a
dream and he had met with a king That doesnt happen to just
anyone
He was plannin g as he left the bar He had remembered that one
of the crystal merchant s suppliers transported his crystal  by means
of caravans that crossed the desert He held Urim and Thummim in
his hand beca use of those two stones he was once again on the
way to his treasure
I am always nearby  when someone wants to realize their
Personal Legend the old king had told him
What could it cost to go over to the supplier s warehouse and find
out if the Pyramids were really that far away
The Englishman was sitting on a bench in a structure that smelled of
animals sweat and dust it was part warehouse part corral I never

===== Page 56 =====
thought Id end up in a place like this he thought as he leafed
through the pages of a chemical journal Ten years at the university 
and here I am in a corral
But he had to move on He believed in omens All his life and all
his studies were aimed at finding the one true langua ge of the
universe First he had studie d Esperanto then the world s religions
and now it was alchemy  He knew how to speak Esperanto he
understood all the major religions well but he wasnt yet an
alchemist He had unraveled the truths behind important questions
but his studies  had taken him to a point beyond which he could not
seem to go He had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an
alchemist But the alchemists  were strange people who thought only
about themselves and almo st always refused to help him Who
knows maybe they had failed to discover the secret of the Master
Workthe Philosopher s Stoneand for this reason kept their
knowledge to themselves
He had already spent much of the fortune left to him by his father 
fruitlessly seeking the Philosopher s Stone He had spent enormous
amounts of time at the great libraries of the world and had
purchased all the rarest and most important volumes on alchemy  In
one he had read that many years ago a famous Arabian alchemist
had visited Europe It was said that he was more than two hundred
years old and that he had discovered the Philosopher s Stone and
the Elixir of Life The Englishman had been profoundly impressed by
the story But he would never  have thought it more than just a myth
had not a friend of hisretur ning from an archaeological expedition
in the deserttold him about an Arab that was possessed of
exceptional powers

===== Page 57 =====
He lives at the AlFayoum oasis his friend had said And people
say that he is two hundred years old and is able to transform any
metal into gold
The Englishman could not contain his excitement He canceled all
his commitments and pulle d together the most important of his
books and now here he was sitting inside a dusty  smelly
warehouse Outside a huge caravan was being prepared for a
crossing of the Sahara and was scheduled to pass through Al
Fayoum
Im going to find that damned alchemist the Englishman thought
And the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable
A young Arab also loaded  down with baggage entered and
greeted the Englishman
Where are you bound asked the young Arab
Im going into the desert the man answered turning back to his
reading He didnt want any conversation at this point What he
needed to do was review all he had learned over the years because
the alchemist would certainly put him to the test
The young Arab took out a book and began to read The book
was written in Spanish Thats good thought the Englishman He
spoke Spanish better than Arabic and if this boy was going to Al
Fayoum there would be someone to talk to when there were no
other important things to do
That s strange  said the boy as he tried once again to read the
burial scene that began the book Ive been trying for two years to
read this book  and I never get past these first few pages Even
without a king to provide an interruption he was unable to
concentrate
He still had some doubts about the decision he had made But he
was able to understand one thing making a decision was only the
beginning of things When someone makes a decision he is really
diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never
dreamed of when he first made the decision

===== Page 58 =====
When I decided to seek out my treasure I never imagined that Id
wind up working in a cryst al shop he thought And joining this
caravan may have been my decision but where it goes is going to
be a mystery to me
Nearby was the Englishman reading a book He seemed
unfriendly  and had looked irritated when the boy had entered They
might even have become friends but the Englishman closed off the
conversation
The boy closed  his book He felt that he didnt want to do anything
that might make him look like the Englishman He took Urim and
Thummim from his pocket and began playing with them
The stranger shouted Urim and Thummim
In a flash the boy put them back in his pocket
Theyre not for sale he said
Theyre not worth much the Englishman answered Theyre
only made of rock crystal and there are millions of rock crystals in
the earth But those who know about such things would  know that
those are Urim  and Thummim I didnt know that they had them in
this part of the world 
They were given to me as a present by a king the boy said
The stranger didnt answer instead he put his hand in his pocket
and took out two stones that were the same as the boy s
Did you say a king he asked
I guess you dont believe that a king would talk to some one like
me a shepherd he said wanting to end the conversation
Not at all It was shepherds who were the first to recogniz e a king
that the rest of the world refused to acknowledge So its not
surprising that kings would talk to shepherds
And he went on fearing that the boy wouldnt understand what he
was talking about Its in the Bible The same book that taught me
about Urim and Thummim These stones were the only form of
divination permitted by God  The priests carried them in a golden
breastplate
The boy was suddenly happy to be there at the warehouse
Maybe this is an omen said the Englishman half aloud
Who told you about omens The boys interest was increasing
by the moment

===== Page 59 =====
Everything in life is an omen  said the Englishman now closing
the journal he was reading There is a universal language
understood by everybody  but already forgotten I am in search of
that universal language among other things That s why Im here I
have to find a man who knows that universal language An
alchemist
The conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss
Youre in luck you two the fat Arab said There s a caravan
leaving today for AlFayoum
But Im going to Egypt the boy said
AlFayoum is in Egypt said the Arab What kind of Arab are
you
That s a good luck omen the Englishman said after the fat Arab
had gone out If I could Id write a huge encyclopedia just about the
words luck and coincidence Its with those words that the universal
language is written
He told the boy it was no coincidence that he had met him with
Urim and Thummim in his hand And he asked the boy if he too
were in search of the alchemist
Im looking for a treasure said the boy and he immediately
regretted having said it But the Englishman appeared not to attach
any importance to it
In a way  so am I he said
I dont even know what alchemy is the boy was saying when
the warehouse boss called to them to come outside
Im the leader of the caravan said a darkeyed beard ed man I
hold the power of life and death for every person I take with me The
desert is a capricious lady  and sometimes she drives men crazy 
There were almost two hund red people gathered there and four
hundred animalscamels horses mules and fowl In the crowd
were women children and a number of men with swor ds at their
belts and rifles slung on their shoulders The Englishman had
several suitcas es filled with books There was a babble of noise and

===== Page 60 =====
the leader had to repeat himself several times for everyone to
understand what he was saying
There are a lot of different people here and each has his own
God But the only God I serve is Allah and in his name I swear that I
will do everything possible once again to win out over the desert But
I want each and every one of you to swear by the God you believe in
that you will follow my orders no matter what In the desert
disobedience means death
There was a murmur from the crowd Each was swearing quietly
to his or her own God The boy swore to Jesus Christ The
Englishman said nothing And the murmur lasted longer than a
simple vow would have The people  were also praying to heaven  for
protection
A long note was sounded on a bugle and everyone mounted up
The boy and the Englishman had bought camels and climbed
uncertainly onto their backs The boy felt sorry for the Englishman s
camel loaded down as he was with the cases of books
There s no such thing as coincidence said the Englishman
picking up the conversation  where it had been interrupted in the
warehouse Im here because a friend of mine heard of an Arab who
  
But the caravan began to move and it was impossible to hear
what the Englishman was saying The boy knew what he was about
to describe though the mysterious chain that links one thing to
another  the same chain that had caused him to become a shepherd
that had caused his recurring dream that had brought him to a city
near Africa to find a king and to be robbed in order to meet a crystal
merchant and   
The closer one gets to realizing his Personal Legend the more
that Personal Legend becom es his true reason for being thought the

===== Page 61 =====
boy
The caravan moved toward  the east It traveled during the
morning halted when the sun was at its strongest and resumed late
in the afternoon The boy spoke very little with the Englishman who
spent most of his time with his books
The boy observed in silence the progress of the animals and
people across the desert Now everything was quite different from
how it was that day they had set out then there had been confusion
and shouting the cries of children and the whinnying of animals all
mixed with the nervous orders of the guides and the merchants
But in the desert there was only the sound of the etern al wind
and of the hoofbeats of the animals Even the guides spoke very little
to one another 
Ive crossed these sands many times said one of the camel
drivers one night But the desert is so huge and the horizons so
distant that they make a person feel small and as if he should
remain silent
The boy understood intuitively what he meant even without ever
having set foot in the desert before Whenever he saw the sea or a
fire he fell silent impressed by their elemental force
Ive learned things from the sheep and Ive learned things from
crystal he thought I can learn something from the desert too It
seems old and wise
The wind never stopped and the boy remembered the day he had
sat at the fort in Tarifa with this same wind blowing in his face It
reminded him of the wool from his sheep    his sheep who were
now seeking food and water in the fields of Andalusia as they
always had
Theyre not my sheep anymore he said to himself without
nostalgia They must be used to their new shepherd and have
probably already forgotten me That s good Creatures like the
sheep that are used to traveling know about moving on
He thought of the merchant s daughter  and was sure that she had
probably married Perhaps to a baker  or to another shepherd who
could read and could tell her exciting storiesafter all he probably
wasnt the only one But he was excited at his intuitive understanding
of the camel driver s comm ent maybe he was also learning the

===== Page 62 =====
universal language that deals with the past and the present of all
people Hunc hes his mother used to call them The boy was
beginning to understand that intuition is really a sudden immersion of
the soul into the universal current of life where the histories of all
people are connected and we are able to know everything because
its all written there
Maktub  the boy said remembering the crystal merchant
The desert was all sand in some stretches and rocky in others
When the caravan was block ed by a boulder  it had to go around it if
there was a large rocky area they had to make a major detour  If the
sand was too fine for the animals hooves they sought a way where
the sand was more substantial In some places the ground was
covered with the salt of dried up lakes The animals balked at such
places and the camel drivers were forced to dismount and unburden
their charges The drivers carried the freight themselves over such
treacherous footing and then reloaded the camels If a guide were to
fall ill or die the camel drivers would draw lots and appoint a new
one
But all this happened for one basic reason no matter how many
detours and adjustments it made the caravan moved toward the
same compass point Once obstacles were overcome it returned to
its course sighting on a star that indicated the location of the oasis
When the peop le saw that star shining in the morning sky they knew
they were on the right course toward water  palm trees shelter  and
other people It was only the Englishman who was unaware of all
this he was for the most part immersed in reading his books
The boy too had his book and he had tried to read it during the
first few days of the journey  But he found it much more interesting to
observe the caravan and listen to the wind As soon as he had
learned to know his camel better  and to establish a relationship with
him he threw the book away Although the boy had developed a

===== Page 63 =====
superstition that each time he opened the book he would learn
something important he decided it was an unnecessary burden
He became friendly with the camel driver who traveled alongside
him At night as they sat around the fire the boy related to the driver
his adventures as a shepherd
During one of these conversations the driver told of his own life
I used to live near El Cairum he said I had my orchard my
children and a life that would change not at all until I died One year
when the crop was the best ever we all went to Mecca and I
satisfied the only unmet oblig ation in my life I could die happily  and
that made me feel good
One day the earth began to tremble and the Nile overflowed its
banks It was something that I thought could happen only to others
never to me My neighbors feared they would lose all their olive trees
in the flood and my wife was afraid that we would lose our children I
thought that everything I owned would be destroyed
The land was ruined and I had to find some other way to earn a
living So now Im a camel driver  But that disaster taught me to
understand the word of Allah people need not fear the unknown if
they are capable of achieving what they need and want 
We are afraid of losing what  we have whether its our life or our
possessions and property  But this fear evaporates when we
understand that our life stories and the history of the world were
written by the same hand
Sometimes their caravan met with another  One always had
something that the other neededas if everything were indeed
written by one hand As they sat around the fire the camel drivers
exchanged information about windstorms and told stories about the
desert
At other times mysterious hooded men would appear they were
Bedouins who did surveillance along the caravan route They
provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes They came in
silence and departed the same way dressed in black garments that
showed only their eyes One night a camel driver came  to the fire
where the Englishman and the boy were sitting There are rumors of
tribal wars he told them

===== Page 64 =====
The three fell silent The boy noted that there was a sense of fear
in the air even though no one said anything Once again he was
experiencing the language without words    the universal language
The Englishman asked if they were in danger 
Once you get into the dese rt there s no going back said the
camel driver  And when you cant go back you have to worry only
about the best way of moving forward The rest is up to Allah
including the danger 
And he concluded by saying the mysterious word Maktub
You should pay more attent ion to the caravan the boy said to
the Englishman after the camel driver had left We make a lot of
detours but were always heading for the same destination
And you ought to read more about the world answered the
Englishman Books are like caravans in that respect
The immense collection of people and animals began to travel
faster  The days had always been silent but now even the nights
when the travelers were accustomed to talking around the fireshad
also become quiet And one day the leader of the caravan made
the decision that the fires should no longer be lighted so as not to
attract attention to the caravan
The travelers adopted the practice of arranging the animals in a
circle at night sleeping together in the center as protection against
the nocturnal cold And the leader posted armed sentinels at the
fringes of the group
The Englishman was unable to sleep one night He called to the
boy and they took a walk along the dunes surrounding the
encampment There was a full moon and the boy told the
Englishman the story of his life 
The Englishman was fascinated with the part about the progress
achieved at the crystal shop after the boy began working there
That s the principle that governs all things he said In alchemy 
its called the Soul of the World When you want something with all
your heart thats when you are closest to the Soul of the World Its
always a positive force
He also said that this was not just a human gift that every thing on
the face of the earth had a soul whether mineral vegetable or
animalor even just a simple thought

===== Page 65 =====
Everything on earth is being continuously transformed because
the earth is alive    and it has a soul We are part of that soul so
we rarely recognize that it is working for us But in the crystal shop
you probably realized that even the glasses were collaborating in
your success
The boy thought about that for a while as he looked at the moon
and the bleach ed sands I have watched the caravan as it crossed
the desert he said The caravan and the desert speak  the same
language and its for that reason that the desert allows the crossing
Its going to test the caravan s every step to see if its in time and if
it is we will make it to the oasis
If either of us had joined this caravan based only on personal
courage but without understanding that language this journey would
have been much more dif ficult
They stood there looking at the moon
That s the magic of omens said the boy Ive seen how the
guides read the signs of the desert and how the soul of the caravan
speaks to the soul of the desert
The Englishman said Id better pay more attention  to the
caravan
And Id better read your books said the boy 
They were strange books They spoke about mercury  salt dragons
and kings and he didnt unde rstand any of it But there was one idea
that seemed to repeat itself throughout all the books all things are
the manifestation of one thing only 
In one of the books he learne d that the most important text in the
literature of alchemy contai ned only a few lines and had been
inscribed on the surface of an emerald
Its the Emerald Tablet said the Englishman proud that he might
teach something to the boy 
Well then why do we need all these books the boy asked
So that we can understand those few lines the Englishman
answered without appearing really to believe what he had said

===== Page 66 =====
The book that most interested the boy told the stories  of the
famous alchemists They were men who had dedicated their entire
lives to the purification of metals in their laboratories they believed
that if a metal  were heated for many years it would free itself of all
its individual properties and what was left would be the Soul of the
World This Soul of the World allowed them to understand anything
on the face of the earth because it was the language with which all
things communicated They called that discovery the Master Work
it was part liquid and part solid
Cant you just observe men and omens in order to understand
the language the boy asked
You have a mania for simplifying everything answered the
Englishman irritated Alchemy is a serious discipline Every step
has to be followed exactly as it was followed by the masters
The boy learne d that the liquid part of the Master Work was called
the Elixir of Life and that it cured all illnesses it also kept the
alchemist from growing old And the solid part was called the
Philosopher s Stone
Its not easy to find the Philosopher s Stone said the
Englishman The alchemists spent years in their laboratories
observing the fire that purifie d the metals They spent so much time
close to the fire that gradually they gave up the vanities of the world
They discovered that the purification of the metals had led to a
purification of themselves
The boy thought about the crystal merchant He had said that it
was a good thing for the boy to clean the crystal pieces so that he
could free himself from negative thoughts The boy was becoming
more and more convinced that alchemy could be learned in ones
daily life
Also said the Englishman the Philosopher s Stone has a
fascinating property  A small sliver of the stone can transform large
quantities of metal into gold
Having heard that the boy became even more interested in
alchemy  He thought that with some patience hed be able to
transform everything into gold He read the lives of the various
people who had succeeded in doing so Helvtius Elias Fulcanelli
and Geber  They were fascin ating stories each of them lived out his

===== Page 67 =====
Personal Lege nd to the end They traveled spoke with wise men
performed miracles for the incredulous and owned the Philosopher s
Stone and the Elixir of Life
But when the boy wanted to learn how to achieve the Master
Work he became completely  lost There were just drawings coded
instructions and obscure texts
Why do they make things so complicated he asked the
Englishman one night The boy had noticed that the Englishman was
irritable and missed his books
So that those who have the responsibility for understanding can
understand he said Imagine if everyone went around transforming
lead into gold Gold would lose its value
Its only those who are persistent and willing to study things
deeply  who achieve the Master Work That s why Im here in the
middle of the desert Im seek ing a true alchemist who will help me to
decipher the codes
When were these books written the boy asked
Many centuries ago
They didnt have the printing press in those days the boy
argued There was no way for everybody to know about alchemy 
Why did they use such strange language with so many drawings
The Englishma n didnt answer him directly  He said that for the
past few days he had been  paying attention to how the caravan
operated but that he hadnt learned anything new The only thing he
had noticed was that talk of war was becoming more and more
frequent
Then one day the boy return ed the books to the Englishman Did
you learn anything the Englishman asked eager to hear what it
might be He needed some one to talk to so as to avoid thinking
about the possibility of war 
I learned that the world has a soul and that whoever understands
that soul can also understan d the language of things I learned that

===== Page 68 =====
many alchemists realized their Personal Legends and wound up
discovering the Soul of the World the Philosopher s Stone and the
Elixir of Life
But above all I learned that these things are all so simple that
they could be written on the surface of an emerald
The Englishman was disappointed The years of research the
magic symbols  the strange words and the laboratory equipment   
none of this had made an impression on the boy His soul must be
too primitive to understand those things he thought
He took back his books and packed them away again in their
bags
Go back to watching the caravan he said That didnt teach me
anything either 
The boy went back to contemplating the silence of the desert and
the sand raised by the anima ls Everyone has his or her own way of
learning things he said to himself His way isnt the same as mine
nor mine as his But were both in search of our Persona l Legends
and I respect him for that
The caravan began to trave l day and night The hooded  Bedouins
reappeared more and more frequently  and the camel driverwho
had become a good friend of the boysexplained that the war
between the tribes had alrea dy begun The caravan would be very
lucky to reach the oasis
The animals were exhausted and the men talked among
themselves less and less The silence was the worst aspect of the
night when the mere groan of a camelwhich before had been
nothing but the groan of a camelnow frightened everyone
because it might signal a raid
The camel driver  though seemed not to be very concerned with
the threat of war 
Im alive he said to the boy as they ate a bunch of dates one
night with no fires and no moon When Im eating thats all I think
about If Im on the march I just concentrate on marching If I have to
fight it will be just as good a day to die as any other

===== Page 69 =====
Because I dont live in either my past or my future Im interested
only in the present If you can concentrate always on the present
youll be a happy man Youll see that there is life in the desert that
there are stars in the heavens and that tribesmen fight because they
are part of the human race Life will be a party for you a grand
festival because life is the moment were living right now 
Two nights later as he was getting ready to bed down the boy
looked for the star they followed every night He thoug ht that the
horizon was a bit lower than it had been because he seemed to see
stars on the desert itself
Its the oasis said the camel driver 
Well why dont we go there right now the boy asked
Because we have to sleep
The boy awoke as the sun rose There in front of him where the
small stars had been the night before was an endless row of date
palms stretching across the entire desert
Weve done it said the Englishman who had also awakened
early 
But the boy was quiet He was at home with the silence of the
desert and he was content just to look at the trees He still had a
long way to go to reach the Pyramids and someday this morning
would just be a memory  But this was the present momentthe party
the camel drive r had mentionedand he wanted to live it as he did
the lessons of his past and his dreams of the future Although the
vision of the date palms would someday be just a memory  right now

===== Page 70 =====
it signified shade water  and a refuge from the war Yesterday  the
camel s groan signaled danger  and now a row of date palms could
herald a miracle
The world speaks many languages the boy thought
The times rush past and so do the caravans thought the alchemist
as he watched the hundreds  of people and animals arriving at the
oasis People were shouting  at the new arrivals dust obscured the
desert sun and the childr en of the oasis were bursting with
excitement at the arrival of the strangers The alchemist saw the
tribal chiefs greet the leader of the caravan and convers e with him
at length
But none of that mattered to the alchemist He had alrea dy seen
many people come and go and the desert remained as it was He
had seen kings and beggars walking the desert sands The dunes
were changed constantly by the wind yet these were the same
sands he had known since he was a child He alway s enjoyed
seeing the happiness that the travelers experienced when after
weeks of yellow sand and blue sky they first saw the green of the
date palms Maybe God created the desert so that man could
appreciate the date trees he thought
He decided to concentrate on more practical matters He knew
that in the caravan there was a man to whom he was to teach some
of his secrets The omens had told him so He didnt know the man
yet but his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared
He hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous
apprentice
I dont know why these things have to be transmitted by word of
mouth he thought It wasnt exactly that they were secrets God
revealed his secrets easily to all his creatures
He had only one explanation for this fact things have to be
transmitted this way because they were made up from the pure life
and this kind of life cannot be captured in pictures or words
Because people become fascinated with pictures and words and
wind up forgetting the Language of the W orld

===== Page 71 =====
The boy couldnt believe what he was seeing the oasis rather than
being just a well surrounded  by a few palm treesas he had seen
once in a geog raphy bookwas much larger than many towns back
in Spain There were three hundred wells fifty thousand date trees
and innumerable colored tents spread among them
It looks like A Thousand and One Nights  said the Englishman
impatient to meet with the alchemist
They were surrounded by children curious to look at the animals
and people that were arriving The men of the oasis wanted to know
if they had seen any fighting and the women competed with one
another for access to the cloth and precious stones brought by the
merchants The silence of the desert was a distant dream the
travelers in the caravan were talking incessantly  laughing and
shouting as if they had emerged from the spiritual world  and found
themselves once again in the world of people They were relieved
and happy 
They had been taking careful precautions in the desert but the
camel driver explained to the boy that oases were always considered
to be neutral territories beca use the majority of the inhabitants were
women and children There were oases throughout the desert but
the tribesmen fought in the desert leaving the oases as places of
refuge
With some difficulty  the leader of the caravan brought all his
people together and gave them his instructions The group was to
remain there at the oasis until the conflict between the tribes was
over Since they were visitors  they would have to share living space
with those who lived there and would be given the best
accommodations That was the law of hospitality  Then he asked that
everyone including his own sentinels hand over their arms to the
men appointed by the tribal chieftains
Those are the rules of war the leader explained The oases
may not shelter armies or troops
To the boys surprise the Englishman took a chromeplated
revolver out of his bag and gave it to the men who were  collecting
the arms

===== Page 72 =====
Why a revolver he asked
It helped me to trust in people the Englishman answered
Meanwhile the boy thought about his treasure The closer he got
to the realizati on of his dream the more difficult things became It
seemed as if what the old king had called beginner s luck were no
longer functio ning In his pursuit of the dream he was being
constantly subjected to tests  of his persistence and courage So he
could not be hasty  nor impa tient If he pushed forward impulsively 
he would fail to see the signs and omens left by God along his path
God placed them along my path He had surprised himself with
the thought Until then he had considered the omens to be things of
this world Like eating or sleeping or like seeking love or finding a
job He had never thought of them in terms of a language used by
God to indicate what he should do 
Dont be impatient he repeated to himself Its like the camel
driver said Eat when its time to eat And move along when its time
to move along
That first day everyone slept from exhaustion including the
Englishman The boy was assigned a place far from his friend in a
tent with five other young men of about his age They were people of
the desert and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities
The boy told them about his life as a shepherd and was about to
tell them of his experiences at the crystal shop when the Englishman
came into the tent
Ive been looking for you all morning he said as he led the boy
outside I need you to help me find out where the alchemist lives
First they tried to find him on their own An alchemist would
probably live in a manner that was different from that of the rest of
the people at the oasis and it was likely that in his tent an oven was
continuously burning They searched everywhere and found that the
oasis was much larger than they could have imagined there were
hundreds of tents

===== Page 73 =====
Weve wasted almost the entire day said the Englishman sitting
down with the boy near one of the wells 
Maybe wed better ask someone the boy suggested
The Englishma n didnt want to tell others about his reasons for
being at the oasis and couldnt make up his mind But finally  he
agreed that the boy who spoke better Arabic than he should do so
The boy approached a wom an who had come to the well to fill a
goatskin with water 
Good afternoo n maam Im trying to find out where the alchemist
lives here at the oasis
The woman said she had never heard of such a person and
hurried away  But before she fled she advised the boy that he had
better not try to converse with women who were dresse d in black
because they were married women He should respect tradition
The Englishman was disappointed It seemed he had made the
long journey for nothing The boy was also saddened his friend was
in pursu it of his Personal Legend And when someone was in such
pursuit the entire universe made an effort to help him succeed
thats what the old king had said He couldnt have been wrong
I had never heard of alchemists before the boy said Maybe no
one here has either 
The Englishman s eyes lit up That s it Maybe no one here knows
what an alchemist is Find out who it is who cures the people s
illnesses 
Several women dressed in black came to the well for water  but
the boy would speak to none of them despite the Englishman s
insistence Then a man approached
Do you know someone here who cures people s illnesses the
boy asked
Allah cures our illnesses said the man clearly frightened of the
strangers Youre looking for witch doctors He spoke some verses
from the Koran and moved on

===== Page 74 =====
Another man appeared He was older  and was carrying  a small
bucket The boy repeated his question
Why do you want to find that sort of person the Arab asked
Because my friend here has traveled for many months in order to
meet with him the boy said
If such  a man is here at the oasis he must be the very powerful
one said the old man after thinking for a few moments Not even
the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to Only
when he consents
Wait for the end of the war Then leave with the caravan Dont try
to enter into the life of the oasis he said and walked away 
But the Englishman was exultant They were on the right track
Finally  a young woman approached who was not dressed in
black She had a vessel on her shoulder  and her head was covered
by a veil but her face was uncovered The boy approac hed her to
ask about the alchemist
At that momen t it seemed to him that time stood still and the
Soul of the World surged within him When he looked into her dark
eyes and saw that her lips were poised between a laugh and
silence he learned the most important part of the langua ge that all
the world spok ethe langua ge that everyone on earth was capable
of unde rstanding in their heart It was love Something older than
humanity  more ancient than the desert Something that exerted the
same force whenever two pairs of eyes met as had theirs here at
the well She smiled and that was certainly an omenth e omen he
had been awaiting without even knowing he was for all his life The

===== Page 75 =====
omen he had sought to find with his sheep and in his books in the
crystals and in the silence of the desert
It was the pure Language of the World It required no explanation
just as the universe needs none as it travels through endless time
What the boy felt at that moment was that he was in the presence of
the only woman in his life and that with no need for words she
recognized the same thing He was more certain of it than of
anything in the world He had been told by his parents and
grandparents that he must fall in love and really know  a person
before becoming committed But maybe people who felt that way
had never learned the universal language Because when you know
that language  its easy to understand that someone in the world
awaits you whether its in the middle of the desert or in some great
city And when two such people encounter each other  and their eyes
meet the past and the future  become unimportant There is only that
moment and the incredible certainty that everything under the sun
has been written by one hand only It is the hand that evokes love
and creates a twin soul for every person in the world Without such
love one s dreams would have no meaning
Maktub  thought the boy 
The Englishman shook the boy Come on ask her
The boy stepped closer to the girl and when she smiled he did
the same
What s your name he asked
Fatima the girl said averting her eyes
That s what some women in my country are called
Its the name of the Prophet s daughter  Fatima said The
invaders carried the name everywhere The beautiful girl spoke of
the invaders with pride
The Englishman prodded him and the boy asked her about the
man who cured people s illnesses 
That s the man who knows all the secrets of the world she said
He communicates with the genies of the desert
The genies were the spirits of good and evil And the girl pointed
to the south indicating that it was there the strange man lived Then
she filled her vessel with water and left

===== Page 76 =====
The Englishman vanished too gone to find the alchemist And
the boy sat there by the well for a long time rememberin g that one
day in Tarifa the levanter had brought to him the perfume of that
woman and realizing that he had loved her before he even knew
she existed He knew that his love for her would enable him to
discover every treasure in the world
The next day the boy returned to the well hoping to see the girl
To his surprise the Englishman was there looking out at the desert
I waited all afternoon and evening he said He appeared with
the first stars of evening I told him what I was seeking and he asked
me if I had ever transformed lead into gold I told him that was what I
had come here to learn
He told me I should try to do so That s all he said Go and try 
The boy didnt say anything The poor Englishman had traveled all
this way only to be told that he should repeat what he had already
done so many times
So then try  he said to the Englishman
That s what Im going to do Im going to start now 
As the Englishman left Fatim a arrived and filled her vessel with
water 
I came to tell you just one thing the boy said I want you to be
my wife I love you
The girl dropped the container  and the water spilled
Im going to wait here for you every day I have crossed the
desert in search of a treasure  that is somewhere near the Pyramids
and for me the war seemed a curse But now its a blessing
because it brought me to you
The war is going to end someday  the girl said
The boy looked around him at the date palms He reminded
himself that he had been a shepherd and that he could be a

===== Page 77 =====
shepherd again Fatima was more important than his treasure
The tribesmen are always in search of treasure the girl said as
if she had guessed what he was thinking And the women of the
desert are proud of their tribesmen
She refilled her vessel and left
The boy went to the well every day to meet with Fatima  He told
her about his life as a shepherd about the king and about the
crystal shop They became friend s and except for the fifteen
minutes he spent with her each day seemed that it would never
pass When he had been at the oasis for almost a month  the leader
of the caravan  called a meeting of all of the people traveling with
him
We dont know  when the war will end so we cant continue our
journey  he said The battles  may last for a long time perhaps even
years There are powerful forces on both sides and the war is
important to both armies Its not a battle of good against evil Its a
war between forces that are fighting for the balance of power  and
when that type of battle begin s it lasts longer than others because
Allah is on both sides
The people went back to where they were living and the boy went
to meet with Fatima that afternoon He told her about the morning s
meeting The day after we met Fatima said you told me that you
loved me Then you taught me something of the universal language
and the Soul of the World Because of that I have become a part of
you
The boy listened to the sound of her voice and thought it to be
more beautiful than the sound of the wind in the date palms
I have been waiting for you here at this oasis for a long time I
have forgotten  about my past about my traditions and the way in
which men of the desert expect women to behave Ever since I was
a child I have dreamed that the desert would bring me a wonderful
present Now  my present has arrived and it s you
The boy wante d to take her hand But Fatima s hands held to the
handles of her jug
You have told me about your dreams about the old king and your
treasure And youve told me about omens So now I fear nothing

===== Page 78 =====
because it was those omens that brought you to me And I am a part
of your dream a part of your Personal Legend as you call it
That s why I want you to continue toward your goal If you have to
wait until the war is over then wait But if you have to go before then
go on in pursuit of your dream  The dunes are changed by the wind
but the desert never changes That s the way it will be with our love
for each other 
Maktub  she said If I am really a part of your dream youll
come back one day 
The boy was sad as he left her that day He thought of all the
married shepherds he had known They had a difficult time
convincing their wives that they had to go off into distant fields Love
required them to stay with the people they loved
He told Fatima that at their next meeting
The desert takes our men from us and they dont always return
she said We know that and we are used to it Those who dont
return become  a part of the clouds a part of the animals that hide in
the ravines and of the water that comes from the earth They
become a part of everything    they become the Soul of the W orld
Some do come back And then the other women are happy
because they believe that their men may one day return  as well I
used to look at those women and envy them their happiness Now I
too will be one of the women who wait
Im a desert woman and Im proud of that I want my husband to
wander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes And if I have to I
will accept the fact that he has become a part of the clouds and the
animals and the water of the desert
The boy went to look for the Englishman He wanted to tell him
about Fatima He was surprised when he saw that the Englishman
had built himse lf a furnace outside his tent It was a strange furnace
fueled by firewood with a transparent flask heating on top As the
Englishman stared out at the desert his eyes seemed brighter than
they had when he was reading his books
This is the first phase of the job he said I have to sepa rate out
the sulfur To do that successfully  I must have no fear of failure It
was my fear of failure that first kept me from attempting the Master

===== Page 79 =====
Work Now Im beginning what I could have started ten years ago
But Im happy at least that I didnt wait twenty years 
He continued to feed the fire and the boy stayed on until the
desert turned pink in the setting sun He felt the urge to go out into
the desert to see if its silence held the answers to his questions
He wandered for a while keeping the date palms of the oasis
within sight He listened to the wind and felt the stones beneath his
feet Here and there he found a shell and realized that the desert in
remote times had been a sea He sat on a stone and allowed
himself to become hypnotize d by the horizon He tried to deal with
the concept of love as distinct from possession and couldnt
separate them  But Fatima was a woman of the desert and if
anything could help him to understand it was the desert
As he sat there thinking he sensed movement above him
Looking up he saw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky 
He watched the hawks as they drifted on the wind Although their
flight appeared  to have no pattern it made a certain kind of sense to
the boy It was just that he couldnt grasp what it meant He followed
the movement of the birds trying to read something into it Maybe
these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without
ownership
He felt sleepy  In his heart he wanted to remain awake  but he
also wanted to sleep I am learning the Language of the World and
everything in the world is beginning to make sense to me    even
the flight of the hawks he said to himself And in that mood he was
grateful to be in love When you are in love things make even more
sense he thought
Suddenly  one of the hawks made a flashing dive through the sky
attacking the other  As it did so a sudden fleeting image came to

===== Page 80 =====
the boy an army  with its swords at the ready  riding into the oasis
The vision vanished immed iately  but it had shaken him He had
heard people speak of mirages and had already seen some himself
they were desires that beca use of their intensity  materialized over
the sands of the desert But he certainly didnt desire that an army
invade the oasis
He wanted to forget about the vision and return to his meditation
He tried again to concentrate  on the pink shades of the desert and
its stones But there was something there in his heart that wouldnt
allow him to do so
Always heed the omens the old king had said The boy recalled
what he had seen in the vision and sensed that it was actually going
to occur 
He rose and made his way back toward the palm trees Once
again he perceived the many languages in the things about him this
time the dese rt was safe and it was the oasis that had become
dangerous 
The camel driver was seated at the base of a palm tree observing
the sunset He saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes
An army is coming the boy said I had a vision
The desert fills men s hearts with visions the camel driver
answered
But the boy told him about the hawks that he had been watching
their flight and had suddenly felt himself to have plunged to the Soul
of the W orld
The camel driver understood what the boy was saying He knew
that any given thing on the face of the earth could reveal the history
of all things One could open a book to any page or look at a
person s hand one could turn a card or watch the flight of the birds
   whatever the thing observed one could find a connection with
his experience of the moment Actually  it wasnt that those things in
themselves revealed anything at all it was just that peop le looking
at what was occurring around them could find a means of
penetration to the Soul of the W orld
The desert was full of men who earned their living based  on the
ease with which they could penetrate to the Soul of the World They
were known as seers and they were held in fear by women and the

===== Page 81 =====
elderly  Tribesm en were also wary of consulting them because it
would be impo ssible to be effective in battle if one knew that he was
fated to die The tribesmen preferred the taste of battle and the thrill
of not knowing what the outcome would be the future was already
written by Allah and what he had written was always for the good of
man So the tribesmen lived only for the present because the
present was full of surprises  and they had to be aware of many
things Where was the enemy s sword Where was his horse What
kind of blow should one deliver next in order to remain alive The
camel driver was not a fighter  and he had consulted with seers
Many of them had been right about what they said while some had
been wrong Then one day the oldest seer he had ever sought out
and the one most to be feared had asked why the camel driver was
so interested in the future
Well    so I can do things he had responded And so I can
change those things that I dont want to happen
But then they wouldnt be a part of your future the seer had
said
Well maybe I just want to know the future so I can prepare
myself for what s coming
If good things are coming they will be a pleasant surpris e said
the seer If bad things are and you know in advance you will suffer
greatly before they even occur 
I want to know about the future because Im a man the camel
driver had said to the seer And men always live their lives based on
the future 
The seer was a specialist in the casting of twigs he threw them on
the ground and made interp retations based on how they fell That
day he didnt make a cast He wrapped the twigs in a piece of cloth
and put them back in his bag
I make  my living forecasting the future for people he said I
know the science of the twigs and I know how to use them to
penetrate to the place where all is written There I can read the past
discover what has already been forgotten and understand the
omens that are here in the present
When people consult me its not that Im reading the future I am
guessing at the future The future belongs to God and it is only he

===== Page 82 =====
who reveals it under extraordinary circumstances How do I guess
at the future Based on the omens of the present The secret is here
in the present If you pay attention to the present you can improve
upon it And if you improve on the present what comes later will
also be better  Forget about the future and live each day according
to the teachings confident that God loves his children Each day in
itself brings with it an eternity 
The camel driver had asked what the circumstances were under
which God would allow him to see the future
Only when he himself reveals it And God only rarely reveals the
future When he does so it is for only one reason its a future that
was written so as to be altered
God had shown the boy a part of the future the came l driver
thought Why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his
instrument
Go and speak to the tribal chieftains said the camel driver  Tell
them about the armies that are approaching
Theyll laugh at me
They are men of the desert and the men of the desert are used
to dealing with omens
Well then they probably already know 
Theyre not concerned with that right now They believe that if
they have to know about something Allah wants them  to know 
someone will tell them about it It has happened many times before
But this time the person is you
The boy thought of Fatima And he decided he would go to see
the chiefs of the tribes
The boy appro ached the guard at the front of the huge white tent at
the center of the oasis
I want to see the chieftains Ive brought omens from the desert
Without responding the guard entered the tent where he
remained for some time When he emerged it was with a young
Arab dressed in white and gold The boy told the younger man what

===== Page 83 =====
he had seen and the man asked him to wait there He disappeared
into the tent
Night fell and an assortment of fighting men and merchants
entered and exited the tent One by one the campfires were
extinguished and the oasis fell as quiet as the desert Only the lights
in the great tent remained During all this time the boy thought about
Fatima and he was still unable to understand his last conversation
with her 
Finally  after hours of waiting the guard bade the boy enter  The
boy was astonished by what he saw inside Never could he have
imagined that there in the middle of the desert there existed a tent
like this one The ground was covered with the most beautiful
carpets he had ever walked upon and from the top of the structure
hung lamps of handwrought  gold each with a lighted candle The
tribal chieftains were seated at the back of the tent in a semicircle
resting upon richly embroidered silk cushions Servants came and
went with silver trays laden with spices and tea Other servants
maintained the fires in the hookahs The atmosphere was suffused
with the sweet scent of smoke
There were eight chieftains  but the boy could see immediately
which of them was the most important an Arab dressed in white and
gold seated at the center of the semicircle At his side was the
young Arab the boy had spoken with earlier 
Who is this stranger who speaks of omens asked one of the
chieftains eyeing the boy 
It is I the boy answered And he told what he had seen

===== Page 84 =====
Why would the desert revea l such things to a stranger  when it
knows that we have been here for generations said another of the
chieftains
Because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert the boy
said I can see things that eyes habituated to the desert might not
see
And also beca use I know about the Soul of the World he thought
to himself
The oasis is neutral ground No one attacks an oasis  said a
third chieftain
I can only tell you what I saw If you dont want to believe me you
dont have to do anything about it
The men fell into an anima ted discussion They spok e in an
Arabic dialect that the boy didnt understand but when he made to
leave the guard told him to stay The boy became fearful the omens
told him that something was wrong He regretted having spoken to
the camel driver about what he had seen in the desert
Suddenly  the elder at the center smiled almost imperceptibly  and
the boy felt better  The man hadnt participated in the discussion
and in fact hadnt said a word up to that point But the boy was
already used to the Language of the World and he could feel the
vibrations of peace throughout the tent Now his intuition was that he
had been right in coming
The discussion ended The chieftains were silent for a few
moments as they listened to what the old man was saying Then he
turned to the boy this time his expression was cold and distant
Two thousand years ago in a distant land a man who believed in
dreams was thrown into a dungeon and then sold as a slave the old
man said now in the dialec t the boy understood Our merchants
bought that man and broug ht him to Egypt All of us know that
whoever believes in dreams also knows how to interpret them
The elder continued When  the pharaoh dreamed of cows that
were thin and cows that were fat this man Im speaking of rescued
Egypt from famine His name was Joseph He too was a stranger in
a strange land like you and he was probably about your age
He paused and his eyes were still unfriendly

===== Page 85 =====
We always observe the Tradition The Tradition saved Egypt from
famine in those days and made the Egyptians the wealthiest of
peoples The Tradition teaches men how to cross the desert and
how their children should marry  The Tradition says that an oasis is
neutral territor y because both sides have oases and so both are
vulnerable
No one said a word as the old man continued
But the Tradition also says that we should believe the messages
of the desert Everything we know was taught to us by the desert
The old man gave a signal and everyone stood The meeting was
over The hookahs were extinguished and the guards stood at
attention The boy made ready to leave but the old man spoke
again
Tomorrow  we are going to break the agreement that says that no
one at the oasis may carry arms Throughout the entire day we will
be on the lookout for our enemies When the sun sets the men will
once again surrender their arms to me For every ten dead men
among our enemies you will receive a piece of gold
But arms cannot be drawn unless they also go into battle Arms
are as capricious as the desert and if they are not used the next
time they might not function If at least one of them hasnt been used
by the end of the day tomorrow  one will be used on you
When the boy left the tent the oasis was illuminated only by the
light of the full moon He was twenty minutes from his tent and
began to make his way there
He was alarmed by what had happened He had succeeded in
reaching through to the Soul of the World and now the price for
having done so might be his life It was a frightening bet But he had
been making risky bets ever since the day he had sold his sheep to
pursue his Personal Legend And as the camel driver had said to
die tomorrow was no worse than dying on any other day Every day
was there to be lived or to mark ones departure from this world
Everything depended on one word Maktub
Walking along in the silence he had no regrets If he died
tomorrow  it would be becau se God was not willing to change the
future He would at least have died after having crossed the strait
after having worked in a crystal shop and after having known the

===== Page 86 =====
silence of the desert and Fatima s eyes He had lived every one of
his days intensely since he had left home so long ago If he died
tomorrow  he would already have seen more than other shepherds
and he was proud of that
Suddenly he heard a thunder ing sound and he was throw n to the
ground by a wind such as he had never known The area was
swirling in dust so intense that it hid the moon from view Before him
was an enormous white horse rearing over him with a frightening
scream
When the blind ing dust had settled a bit the boy trembled  at what
he saw Astride the animal was a horseman dressed completely in
black with a falcon perched on his left shoulder  He wore a turban
and his entire face except for his eyes was covered with a black
kerchief He appeared to be a messenger from the dese rt but his
presence was much more powerful than that of a mere messenger 
The strange horseman drew  an enormous curved sword from a
scabbard mounted on his saddle The steel of its blade glittered in
the light of the moon
Who dares to read the meaning of the flight of the hawks he
demanded so loudly that his words seemed to echo throu gh the fifty
thousand palm trees of AlFayoum
It is I who dared to do so said the boy He was reminde d of the
image of Santiago Matamoro s mounted on his white horse with the

===== Page 87 =====
infidels beneath his hooves  This man looked exactly the same
except that now the roles were reversed
It is I who dared to do so he repeated and he lowered his head
to receive a blow from the sword Many lives will be saved because
I was able to see through to the Soul of the W orld
The sword didnt fall Instead the stranger lowered it slowly  until
the point touched the boy s forehead It drew a droplet of blood
The horseman was complete ly immobile as was the boy It didnt
even occur to the boy to flee In his heart he felt a strang e sense of
joy he was about to die in pursuit of his Personal Legend And for
Fatima The omens had been true after all Here he was faceto
face with his enemy  but there was no need to be conce rned about
dyingthe Soul of the World awaited him and he would soon be a
part of it And tomorrow  his enemy would also be a part of that
Soul
The stranger continued to hold the sword at the boys forehead
Why did you read the flight of the birds
I read only what the birds wanted to tell me They wanted  to save
the oasis Tomorrow all of you will die because there are more men
at the oasis than you have
The sword remained where it was Who are you to change what
Allah has willed
Allah created the armies and he also created the hawks Allah
taught me the language of the birds Everything has been written by
the same hand the boy said remembering the camel driver s
words
The stranger withdrew the sword from the boys forehead and the
boy felt immensely relieved But he still couldnt flee
Be careful with your prognostications said the stranger  When
something is written there is no way to change it
All I saw was an army  said the boy I didnt see the outcome of
the battle 
The stranger seemed satisfie d with the answer  But he kept the
sword in his hand What is a stranger doing in a strange land
I am following my Personal Legend Its not something you would
understand

===== Page 88 =====
The stranger placed his sword in its scabbard and the boy
relaxed
I had to test your courage  the stranger said Courage is the
quality most essential to understanding the Language of the W orld
The boy was surprised The stranger was speaking of things that
very few people knew about
You must not let up even after having come so far he
continued You must love the desert but never trust it completely 
Because the desert tests all men it challenges every step and kills
those who become distracted
What he said reminded the boy of the old king
If the warriors come here and your head is still on your shoulders
at sunset come and find me said the stranger 
The same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip
The horse reared again raising a cloud of dust
Where do you live shouted the boy as the horseman rode
away 
The hand with the whip pointed to the south
The boy had met the alchemist
Next morning there were two thousand armed men scattered
throughout the palm trees at AlFayoum Before the sun had reached
its high point five hundred tribesmen appeared on the horizon The
mounted troop s entered the oasis from the north it appea red to be a
peaceful exped ition but they all carried arms hidden in their robes
When they reached the white tent at the center of AlFayoum they
withdrew their scimitars and rifles And they attacked an empty tent
The men of the oasis surrounded the horsemen from the desert
and within half an hour all but one of the intruders were dead The
children had been kept at the other side of a grove of palm trees
and saw nothing of what had happened The women had remained
in their tents praying for the safekeeping of their husbands and saw
nothing of the battle either  Were it not for the bodies there on the
ground it would have appeared to be a normal day at the oasis

===== Page 89 =====
The only tribesman spared was the commander of the battalion
That afternoon he was brought before the tribal chieftains who
asked him why he had violated the Tradition The commander said
that his men had been starv ing and thirsty  exhausted from many
days of battle and had decid ed to take the oasis so as to be able to
return to the war 
The tribal chieftain said that he felt sorry for the tribesmen but
that the Tradition was sacred He condemned the commander to
death without honor  Rather than being killed by a blade or a bullet
he was hanged from a dead palm tree where his body twisted in the
desert wind
The tribal chieftain called for the boy and presented him with fifty
pieces of gold He repeated his story about Joseph of Egypt and
asked the boy to become the counselor of the oasis
When the sun had set and the first stars made their appea rance the
boy started to walk to the south He eventually sighted a single tent
and a group of Arabs passi ng by told the boy that it was a place
inhabited by genies But the boy sat down and waited
Not until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view He
carried two dead hawks over his shoulder 
I am here the boy said
You shouldnt be here the alchemist answered Or is it your
Personal Legend that brings you here
With the wars between the tribes its impossible to cross the
desert So I have come here
The alchemist dismounted from his horse and signaled that the
boy should enter the tent with him It was a tent like many at the
oasis The boy looked around  for the ovens  and other apparatus
used in alchem y but saw none There were only some books in a
pile a small cooking stove and the carpets covered with mysterious
designs
Sit down Well have something to drink and eat these hawks
said the alchemist

===== Page 90 =====
The boy suspected that they were the same hawks he had seen
on the day before but he said nothing The alchemist lighted the fire
and soon a delicious aroma  filled the tent It was better than the
scent of the hookahs
Why did you want to see me the boy asked
Because of the omens the alchemist answered The wind told
me you would be coming and that you would need help
Its not I the wind spoke about Its the other foreig ner the
Englishman He s the one that s looking for you
He has other things to do first But hes on the right track He has
begun to try to understand the desert
And what about me
When a person really desires something all the universe
conspires to help that person to realize his dream said the
alchemist echoing the word s of the old king The boy understood
Another person was there to help him toward his Personal Legend
So you are going to instruct me
No You already know all you need to know  I am only going to
point you in the direction of your treasure
But there s a tribal war  the boy reiterated
I know what s happening in the desert
I have already found my treasure I have a camel I have my
money from the crystal shop and I have fifty gold pieces In my own
country  I would be a rich man
But none of that is from the Pyramids said the alchemist
I also have Fatima She is a treasure greater than anything else I
have won
She wasnt found at the Pyramids either 
They ate in silence The alchemist opened a bottle and poured a
red liquid into the boys cup It was the most delicious wine he had
ever tasted
Isnt wine prohibited here the boy asked
Its not what enters men s mouths thats evil said the alchemist
Its what comes out of their mouths that is
The alchemist was a bit daunting but as the boy drank the wine
he relaxed After they finished eating they sat outside the tent under
a moon so brilliant that it made the stars pale

===== Page 91 =====
Drink and enjoy yourself said the alchemist noticing that the
boy was feelin g happier  Rest well tonight as if you were a warrior
preparing for combat Remember that wherever your heart is there
you will find your treasure Youve got to find the treasure so that
everything you have learned along the way can make sense
Tomorrow  sell your camel and buy a horse Cam els are
traitorous they walk thousa nds of paces and never seem to tire
Then suddenly  they kneel and die But horses tire bit by bit You
always know how much you can ask of them and when it is that they
are about to die
The following night the boy appeared at the alchemist s tent with a
horse The alchemist was ready  and he mounted his own steed and
placed the falcon on his left shoulder  He said to the boy Show me
where there is life out in the desert Only those who can see such
signs of life are able to find treasure
They began to ride out over the sands with the moon lighting their
way I dont know if Ill be able to find life in the desert the boy
thought I dont know the desert that well yet
He wanted to say so to the alchemist but he was afraid of the
man They reached the rocky place where the boy had seen the
hawks in the sky  but now there was only silence and the wind 
I dont know how to find life in the desert the boy said I know
that there is life here but I dont know where to look
Life attracts life the alchemist answered
And then the boy understood  He loosened the reins on his horse
who galloped forward over the rocks and sand The alchemist
followed as the boys horse ran for almost half an hour They could
no longer see the palms of the oasisonly the gigantic moon above
them and its silver reflect ions from the stones of the desert
Suddenly  for no apparent reason the boy s horse began to slow 
There s life here the boy said to the alchemist I dont know the
language of the desert but my horse knows the language of life
They dismounted and the alchemist said nothing Advancing
slowly  they searched among the stones The alchemist stopped

===== Page 92 =====
abruptly  and bent to the ground There was a hole there among the
stones The alchemist put his hand into the hole and then his entire
arm up to his shoulder  Something was moving there  and the
alchemist s eyesthe boy could see only his eyessquinted with
his effort His arm seemed to be battling with whatever was in the
hole Then with a motion that startled the boy he withdrew his arm
and leaped to his feet In his hand he grasped a snake by the tail 
The boy leapt as well but away from the alchemist The snake
fought frantically  making hissing sounds that shattered the silence of
the desert It was a cobra whose venom could kill a person in
minutes
Watch out for his venom the boy said But even though the
alchemist had put his hand in the hole and had surely already been
bitten his expression was calm The alchemist is two hundred years
old the Englishman had told him He must know how to deal with
the snakes of the desert
The boy watched as his companion went to his horse and
withdrew a scimitar  With its blade he drew a circle in the sand and
then he placed the snake within it The serpent relaxed immediately 
Not to worry  said the alche mist He wont leave the circle You
found life in the desert the omen that I needed
Why was that so important
Because the Pyramids are surrounded by the desert The boy
didnt want to talk about the Pyramids His heart was heavy  and he
had been melancholy since the previous night To continue his
search for the treasure meant that he had to abandon Fatima
Im going to guide you across the desert the alchemist said 
I want to stay at the oasis the boy answered Ive found Fatima
and as far as Im concerned she s worth more than treasure

===== Page 93 =====
Fatima is a woman of the desert said the alchemist She knows
that men have to go away in order to return And she already has her
treasure its you Now she expects that you will find what it is youre
looking for 
Well what if I decide to stay
Let me tell you what will happen Youll be the counselor of the
oasis You have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels
Youll marry Fatima and youll both be happy for a year Youll learn
to love the desert and youll get to know every one of the fifty
thousand palms Youll watch  them as they grow  demonstrating how
the world is always changing And youll get better and better at
understanding omens because the desert is the best teacher there
is
Sometime during the second year youll remember about the
treasure The omens will begin insistently to speak of it and youll try
to ignore them Youll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis
and its inhabita nts The tribal chieftains will appreciate what you do
And your camels will bring you wealth and power 
During the third year the omens will continue to speak of your
treasure and your Personal Legend Youll walk around night after
night at the oasis and Fatima will be unhappy because shell feel it
was she who interrupted your quest But you will love her and shell
return your love Youll remem ber that she never asked you to stay
because a woman of the desert knows that she must await her man
So you wont blame her But many times youll walk the sands of the
desert thinking that maybe you could have left    that you could
have trusted more in your love for Fatima Because what kept you at
the oasis was your own fear that you might never come back At that
point the omens will tell you that your treasure is buried forever 
Then sometim e during the fourth year the omens will abandon
you because youve stopped  listening to them The tribal chieftains
will see that and youll be dismissed from your position as counselor 
But by then youll be a rich merchant with many camels and a
great deal of merchandise  Youll spend the rest of your days
knowing that you didnt pursue your Personal Legend and that now
its too late

===== Page 94 =====
You must understand that love never keeps a man from pursuing
his Personal Legend If he abandons that pursuit its because it
wasnt true love    the love that speaks the Language of the W orld
The alchemist erased the circle in the sand and the snake
slithered away  among the rocks The boy remembered the crystal
merchant who had always wanted to go to Mecca and the
Englishman in search of the alchemist He thought of the woman
who had trusted in the desert  And he looked out over the desert that
had brought him to the woman he loved
They mounted their horses and this time it was the boy who
followed the alchemist back  to the oasis The wind brought the
sounds of the oasis to them and the boy tried to hear Fatima s
voice
But that night as he had watched the cobra within the circle the
strange horseman with the falcon on his shoulder had spoken of love
and treasure of the women of the desert and of his Personal
Legend
Im going with you the boy said And he immediately felt peace
in his heart
Well leave tomorrow before sunrise was the alchemist s only
response
The boy spent a sleepless night Two hours before dawn he awoke
one of the boys who slept in his tent and asked him to show him
where Fatima lived They went to her tent and the boy gave his
friend enough gold to buy a sheep
Then he asked  his friend to go into the tent where Fatima was
sleeping and to awaken her and tell her that he was waitin g outside
The young Arab did as he was asked and was given enough gold to
buy yet another sheep
Now leave us alone said the boy to the young Arab The Arab
returned to his tent to sleep proud to have helped the counselor of
the oasis and happy at having enough money to buy himself some
sheep

===== Page 95 =====
Fatima appear ed at the entra nce to the tent The two walked out
among the palms The boy knew that it was a violation of the
Tradition but that didnt matter to him now 
Im going away  he said And I want you to know that Im coming
back I love you because   
Dont say anything Fatima interrupted One is loved because
one is loved No reason is needed for loving
But the boy continued I had a dream and I met with a king I
sold crystal and crossed the desert And because the tribes
declared war I went to the well seeking the alchemist So I love you
because the entire universe conspired to help me find you
The two embraced It was the first time either had touched the
other 
Ill be back the boy said
Before this I always looke d to the desert with longin g said
Fatima Now it will be with hope My father went away one day but
he returned to my mother  and he has always come back since
then
They said nothing else They walked a bit farther among the
palms and then the boy left her at the entrance to her tent
Ill return just as your father came back to your mother  he said
He saw that Fatima s eyes were filled with tears
Youre crying
Im a woman of the desert  she said averting her face But
above all Im a woman
Fatima went back to her tent and when daylight came she went
out to do the chores she had done for years But everything had
changed The boy was no longer at the oasis and the oasis would
never again have the same meaning it had had only yesterday  It
would no longe r be a place with fifty thousand palm trees  and three
hundred wells  where the pilgrims arrived relieved at the end of their
long journeys From that day on the oasis would be an empty place
for her 
From that day on it was the desert that would be importa nt She
would look to it every day and would try to guess which star the boy
was following in search of his treasure She would have to send her
kisses on the wind hoping that the wind would touch the boys face

===== Page 96 =====
and would tell him that she was alive That she was waiting for him
a woman awaiting a courageou s man in search of his treasure From
that day on the desert would represent only one thing to her the
hope for his return
Dont think about what youve left behind the alchemist said to the
boy as they began to ride across the sands of the desert Everything
is written in the Soul of the W orld and there it will stay forever 
Men dream more about coming home than about leaving the
boy said He was already reaccustomed to the desert s silence
If what  one finds is made of pure matter  it will never spoil And
one can always come back  If what you had found was only a
moment of light like the explosion of a star you would find nothing
on your return
The man was speaking the language of alchemy  But the boy
knew that he was referring to Fatima
It was difficult not to think about what he had left behind The
desert with its endless monotony  put him to dreaming The boy
could still see the palm trees  the wells and the face of the woman
he loved He could see the Englishman at his experiments and the
camel driver who was a teacher without realizing it Maybe the
alchemist has never been in love the boy thought 
The alchemist rode in front with the falcon on his shoulder  The
bird knew the language of the desert well and whenever they
stopped he flew off in search of game On the first day he returned
with a rabbit and on the second with two birds

===== Page 97 =====
At night they spread their sleeping gear and kept their fires
hidden The desert nights were cold and were becoming darker and
darker as the phases of the moon passed They went on for a week
speaking only of the precautions they needed to follow in order to
avoid the battles between the tribes The war continued and at times
the wind carried the sweet sickly smell of blood Battles  had been
fought nearby  and the wind reminded the boy that there was the
language of omens always ready to show him what his eyes had
failed to observe
On the sevent h day the alchemist decided to make camp earlier
than usual The falcon flew off to find game and the alchemist
offered his water container to the boy 
You are almos t at the end of your journey  said the alchemist I
congratulate you for having pursued your Personal Legend
And youve told me nothin g along the way said the boy I
thought you were going to teach me some of the things you know  A
while ago I rode through the desert with a man who had books on
alchemy  But I wasnt able to learn anything from them
There is only one way to learn the alchemist answer ed Its
through action  Everything you need to know you have learned
through your journey  You need to learn only one thing more
The boy wanted to know what that was but the alchem ist was
searching the horizon looking for the falcon
Why are you called the alchemist
Because that s what I am
And what went wrong when other alchemists tried to make gold
and were unable to do so
They were looking only for gold his companion answered They
were seeking the treasure of their Personal Legend without wanting
actually to live out the Personal Legend
What is it that I still need to know the boy asked
But the alchemist continued to look to the horizon And finally the
falcon returned with their meal They dug a hole and lit their fire in it
so that the light of the flames would not be seen
Im an alchemist simply because Im an alchemist he said as he
prepared the meal I learned the science from my grandfather  who
learned from his father  and so on back to the creation of the world

===== Page 98 =====
In those times the Master Work could be written simply on an
emerald But men began to reject simple things and to write tracts
interpretations and philosophical studies They also began to feel
that they knew  a better way than others had Yet the Emerald Tablet
is still alive today 
What was written on the Emerald Tablet the boy wanted to
know 
The alchemist began to draw in the sand and completed his
drawing in less than five minutes As he drew  the boy thought of the
old king and the plaza where  they had met that day it seemed as if
it had taken place years and years ago
This is what was written on the Emerald Tablet said the
alchemist when he had finished
The boy tried to read what was written in the sand
Its a code said the boy a bit disappointed It looks like what I
saw in the Englishman s books
No the alchemist answere d Its like the flight of those two
hawks it cant be understood  by reason alone The Emerald Tablet
is a direct passage to the Soul of the W orld
The wise men understood that this natural world is only an image
and a copy of paradise The existence of this world is simply a
guarantee that there exists a world that is perfect God created the
world so that through its visible objects men could understand his
spiritual teach ings and the marvels of his wisdom That s what I
mean by action 
Should I understand the Emerald T ablet the boy asked
Perhaps if you were in a laboratory of alchemy  this would be the
right time to study the best way to understand the Emer ald Tablet
But you are in the desert So immerse yourself in it The desert will
give you an understanding of the world in fact anything on the face
of the earth will do that You dont even have to unde rstand the
desert all you have to do is contemplate a simple grain of sand and
you will see in it all the marvels of creation
How do I immerse myself in the desert

===== Page 99 =====
Listen to your heart It knows all things because it came from the
Soul of the W orld and it will one day return there
They crossed the desert for another two days in silence The
alchemist had become much more cautious because they were
approaching the area where the most violent battles were being
waged As they moved along the boy tried to listen to his heart
It was not easy  to do in earlier times his heart had always been
ready to tell its story  but lately that wasnt true There had been
times when his heart spent hours telling of its sadness and at other
times it became so emotional over the desert sunrise that the boy
had to hide his tears His heart beat fastest when it spoke to the boy
of treas ure and more slowly when the boy stared entran ced at the
endless horizo ns of the desert But his heart was never quiet even
when the boy and the alchemist had fallen into silence
Why do we have to listen to our hearts the boy asked when
they had made camp that day 
Because wherever your heart is that is where youll find your
treasure
But my heart is agitated the boy said It has its dreams it gets
emotional and it s become passionate over a woman of the desert It
asks things of me and it keep s me from sleeping many nights when
Im thinking about her 
Well thats good Your heart is alive Keep listening to what it has
to say 
During the next three days the two travelers passed by a number
of arme d tribesmen and saw others on the horizon The boys heart
began to speak of fear It told him stories it had heard from the Soul

===== Page 100 =====
of the World stories of men who sought to find their treasure and
never succeed ed Sometimes it frightened the boy with the idea that
he might not find his treasu re or that he might die there in the
desert At other times it told the boy that it was satisfied it had found
love and riches
My heart is a traitor  the boy said to the alchemist when they
had paused to rest the horses It doesnt want me to go on 
That makes sense the alchemist answered Naturally its afraid
that in pursuing your dream you might lose everything youve won
Well then why should I listen to my heart
Because you will never again be able to keep it quiet Even if you
pretend not to have heard what it tells you it will always be there
inside you repeating to you what youre thinking about life and about
the world
You mean I should listen even if it s treasonous
Treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly  If you know your
heart well it will never be able to do that to you Because youll know
its dreams and wishes and will know how to deal with them
You will never be able to escape from your heart So its better to
listen to what it has to say That way youll never have to fear an
unanticipated blow 
The boy continued to listen  to his heart as they crossed the
desert He came to understan d its dodges and tricks and to accept it
as it was He lost his fear and forgot about his need to go back to
the oasis because one afternoon his heart told him that it was
happy  Even though I complain sometimes it said its because Im
the heart of a person and people s hearts are that way People are
afraid to pursue their most important dreams because they feel that
they dont deserve them or that theyll be unable to achieve them
We their hearts become fearful just thinking of loved ones who go
away forever  or of moments that could have been good but werent
or of treasures  that might have been found but were forever hidden
in the sands Because when these things happen we suf fer terribly 
My heart is afraid that it will have to suffer the boy told the
alchemist one night as they looked up at the moonless sky 
Tell your heart that the fear of suf fering is worse than the suf fering
itself And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of

===== Page 101 =====
its dreams because every second of the search is a second s
encounter with God and with eternity 
Every second of the search is an encounter with God the boy
told his heart When I have been truly searching for my treasure
every day has been luminou s because Ive known that every hour
was a part of the dream that I would find it When I have been truly
searching for my treasure Ive discovered things along the way that I
never would have seen had I not had the courage to try things that
seemed impossible for a shepherd to achieve
So his heart was quiet for an entire afternoon That night the boy
slept deeply and when he awoke his heart began to tell him things
that came from the Soul of the World It said that all people who are
happy have God within them And that happiness could be found in a
grain of sand from the desert as the alchemist had said Because a
grain of sand is a moment of creation and the universe has taken
millions of years to create it Everyone on earth has a treasure that
awaits him his heart said We people s hearts seldom say much
about those treasures beca use people no longer want to go in
search of them We speak of them only to children Later  we simply
let life proceed in its own direction toward its own fate But
unfortunately  very few follow the path laid out for them the path to
their Personal Legends and to happiness Most people see the
world as a threatening place  and because they do the world turns
out indeed to be a threatening place
So we their hearts speak more and more softly  We never stop
speaking out but we begin to hope that our words wont be heard
we dont want people to suffer because they dont follow their
hearts
Why dont people s hearts tell them to continue to follow their
dreams the boy asked the alchemist
Because thats what makes a heart suffer most and hearts dont
like to suf fer
From then on the boy under stood his heart He asked it please
never to stop speaking to him He asked that when he wandered far
from his dreams his heart press  him and soun d the alarm The boy
swore that every time he heard the alarm he would heed its
message

===== Page 102 =====
That night he told all of this to the alchemist And the alchemist
understood that the boys heart had returned to the Soul of the
World
So what should I do now the boy asked
Continue in the direction of the Pyramids said the alchemist
And continue to pay heed to the omens Your heart is still capable of
showing you where the treasure is
Is that the one thing I still needed to know
No the alchemist answered What you still need to know is this
before a dream is realized the Soul of the World tests everything
that was learned along the way It does this not because it is evil but
so that we can in addition to realizing our dreams master the
lessons weve  learned as weve moved toward that dream That s
the point at which most peop le give up Its the point at which as we
say in the language of the desert one dies of thirst just when the
palm trees have appeared on the horizon
Every search begins with beginner s luck And every search ends
with the victor s being severely tested
The boy remembered an old proverb from his country  It said that
the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn
On the following day the first clear sign of danger appeared Three
armed tribesmen approached and asked what the boy and the
alchemist were doing there
Im hunting with my falcon the alchemist answered
Were going to have to searc h you to see whether youre  armed
one of the tribesmen said
The alchemist dismounted slowly  and the boy did the same
Why are you carrying money asked the tribesman when he
had searched the boy s bag
I need it to get to the Pyramids he said
The tribesman  who was searching the alchemist s belongings
found a small crystal flask filled with a liquid and a yellow glass egg
that was slightly larger than a chicken s egg
What are these things he asked

===== Page 103 =====
That s the Philosopher s Stone and the Elixir of Life Its the
Master Work of the alchemists Whoever swallows that elixir will
never be sick again and a fragment from that stone turns any metal
into gold
The Arabs laughed at him and the alchemist laughed along They
thought his answer was amusing and they allowed the boy and the
alchemist to proceed with all of their belongings 
Are you crazy the boy asked the alchemist when they had
moved on What did you do that for
To show you one of lifes simple lessons the alchemist
answered When you posses s great treasures within you and try to
tell others of them seldom are you believed
They continued across the desert With every day that passed the
boys heart became more and more silent It no longer wanted to
know about things of the past or future it was content simply to
contemplate the desert and to drink with the boy from the Soul of
the World The boy and his heart had become friends and neither
was capable now of betraying the other 
When his heart spoke to him it was to provide a stimulus to the
boy and to give him strength because the days of silence there in
the desert were wearisome His heart told the boy what his strongest
qualities were his courage in having given up his sheep and in trying
to live out his Personal Lege nd and his enthusiasm during the time
he had worked at the crystal shop
And his heart told him something else that the boy had never
noticed it told the boy of dangers that had threatened him but that
he had never perceived His heart said that one time it had hidden
the rifle the boy had taken from his father  because of the possibility
that the boy might wound himself And it reminded the boy of the day
when he had been ill and vomiting out in the fields after which he

===== Page 104 =====
had fallen into a deep sleep There had been two thieves farther
ahead who were planning to steal the boys sheep and murder him
But since the boy hadnt passed by they had decided to move on
thinking that he had changed his route
Does a man s heart always help him the boy asked the
alchemist
Mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their
Personal Legends But they do help children drunkards and the
elderly  too
Does that mean that Ill never run into danger
It means only that the heart does what it can the alchemist said
One afternoon they passed  by the encampment of one of the
tribes At each corner of the camp were Arabs garbed in beautiful
white robes with arms at the ready  The men were smoking their
hookahs and trading stories  from the battlefield No one paid any
attention to the two travelers
There s no danger  the boy said when they had moved  on past
the encampment
The alchemist  sounded angry Trust in your heart but never
forget that youre in the desert When men are at war with one
another  the Soul of the World can hear the screams of battle No
one fails to suf fer the consequences of everything under the sun
All things are one the boy thought And then as if the desert
wanted to demonstrate that the alchemist was right two horsemen
appeared from behind the travelers
You cant go any farther  one of them said Youre in the area
where the tribes are at war 
Im not going very far the alchemist answered looking straight
into the eyes of the horsemen They were silent for a moment and
then agreed that the boy and the alchemist could move along
The boy watched the exchange with fascination You dominated
those horsemen with the way you looked at them he said
Your eyes show the strength of your soul answered the
alchemist
That s true the boy thought He had noticed that in the midst of
the multitude of armed men back at the encampment there had
been one who stared fixedly at the two He had been so far away

===== Page 105 =====
that his face wasnt even visible But the boy was certain that he had
been looking at them
Finally  when they had crossed the mountain range that extended
along the entire horizon the alchemist said that they were only two
days from the Pyramids
If were going to go our sepa rate ways soon the boy said then
teach me about alchemy 
You already know about alchemy  It is about penetrating to the
Soul of the World and discovering the treasure that has been
reserved for you
No thats not what I mean  Im talking about transforming lead
into gold
The alchemist fell as silent as the desert and answered the boy
only after they had stopped to eat
Everything in the universe evolved he said And for wise men
gold is the metal that evolved the furthest Dont ask me why I dont
know why  I just know that the T radition is always right
Men have never understoo d the words of the wise So gold
instead of being seen as a symbol of evolution became the basis for
conflict
There are many languages spoken by things the boy said
There was a time when for me a camel s whinnying was nothing
more than whinnying Then it became a signal of danger  And finally 
it became just a whinny again
But then he stopped The alchemist probably already knew all
that
I have known true alchemists the alchemist continued They
locked themselves in their laboratories and tried to evolve as gold
had And they found the Philosopher s Stone because they
understood that when something evolves everything around that
thing evolves as well
Others stumbled upon the stone by accident They already had
the gift and their souls were readier for such things than the souls of
others But they dont count Theyre quite rare
And then there were the others who were interested only in gold
They never found the secret They forgot that lead coppe r and iron
have their own Personal Legends to fulfill And anyone who

===== Page 106 =====
interferes with the Personal Legend of another thing never will
discover his own
The alchemist s words echoed out like a curse He reach ed over
and picked up a shell from the ground
This desert was once a sea he said
I noticed that the boy answered
The alchemist told the boy to place the shell over his ear He had
done that many times when he was a child and had heard the sound
of the sea
The sea has lived on in this shell because thats its Personal
Legend And it will never cease doing so until the desert is once
again covered by water 
They mounted their horses and rode out in the directio n of the
Pyramids of Egypt
The sun was setting when the boys heart sounded a danger signal
They were surrounded by gigantic dunes and the boy looked at the
alchemist to see whether he had sensed anything But he appeared
to be unaware  of any dange r Five minutes later the boy saw two
horsemen waiting ahead of them Before he could say anything to
the alchemist the two horsemen had become ten and then a
hundred And then they were everywhere in the dunes
They were tribesmen dressed in blue with black rings surrounding
their turbans Their faces were hidden behind blue veils with only
their eyes showing
Even from a distance their eyes conveyed the strength of their
souls And their eyes spoke of death

===== Page 107 =====
The two were taken to a nearby military camp A soldier shoved the
boy and the alchemist into a tent where the chief was holding a
meeting with his staf f
These are the spies said one of the men
Were just travelers the alchemist answered
You were seen  at the enemy  camp three days ago And you were
talking with one of the troops there
Im just a man who wanders the desert and knows the stars said
the alchemist  I have no information about troops or about the
movement of the tribes I was simply acting as a guide for my friend
here
Who is your friend the chief asked
An alchemist said the alchemist He understands the forces of
nature And he wants to show you his extraordinary powers 
The boy listened quietly  And fearfully 
What is a foreigner doing here asked another of the men
He has brought money to give to your tribe said the alchemist
before the boy could say a word And seizing the boys bag the
alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief
The Arab accepted them without a word There was enou gh there
to buy a lot of weapons
What is an alchemist he asked finally 
Its a man who understands nature and the world If he wanted to
he could destroy this camp just with the force of the wind
The men laughed They were used to the ravages of war and
knew that the wind could not deliver them a fatal blow Yet each felt
his heart beat a bit faster  They were men of the desert and they
were fearful of sorcerers
I want to see him do it said the chief
He needs three days answered the alchemist He is going to
transform hims elf into the wind just to demonstrate his powers If he
cant do so we humbly offer you our lives for the honor of your
tribe
You cant offer me something  that is already mine the chief said
arrogantly  But he granted the travelers three days
The boy was shaking with fear but the alchemist helped  him out
of the tent

===== Page 108 =====
Dont let them see that youre afraid the alchemist said They
are brave men and they despise cowards
But the boy couldnt even speak He was able to do so only after
they had walke d through the center of the camp There was no need
to imprison them the Arabs simply confiscated their horses So
once again the world had demonstrated its many languages the
desert only moments ago had been endless and free and now it was
an impenetrable wall
You gave them everything I had the boy said Everything Ive
saved in my entire life
Well what good would it be to you if you had to die the
alchemist answered Your money saved us for three days Its not
often that money saves a person s life
But the boy was too frightened to listen to words of wisdom He
had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind He
wasnt an alchemist
The alchemist asked one of the soldiers for some tea and poured
some on the boys wrists A wave of relief washed over him and the
alchemist muttered some words that the boy didnt understand
Dont give in to your fears  said the alchemist in a strangely
gentle voice If you do you wont be able to talk to your heart 
But I have no idea how to turn myself into the wind
If a person is living out his Personal Legend he knows everything
he needs to know There is only one thing that makes a dream
impossible to achieve the fear of failure
Im not afraid of failing Its just that I dont know how to turn
myself into the wind
Well youll have to learn your life depends on it
But what if I cant
Then youll die in the mids t of trying to realize your Personal
Legend That s a lot better than dying like millions of other people
who never even knew what their Personal Legends were
But dont worry  the alchem ist continued Usually the threat of
death makes people a lot more aware of their lives

===== Page 109 =====
The first day passed There was a major battle nearby  and a
number of wounded were brought back to the camp The dead
soldiers were replaced by others and life went on Death doesnt
change anything the boy thought
You could have died later on a soldier said to the body of one of
his companions You could have died after peace had been
declared But in any case you were going to die
At the end of the day the boy went looking for the alchem ist who
had taken his falcon out into the desert
I still have no idea how to turn myself into the wind the boy
repeated
Remember what I told you the world is only the visible aspect of
God And that what alchemy does is to bring spiritual perfection into
contact with the material plane
What are you doing
Feeding my falcon
If Im not able to turn myself into the wind were going to die the
boy said Why feed your falcon
Youre the one who may die the alchemist said I already know
how to turn myself into the wind
On the second  day the boy climbed to the top of a cliff near the
camp The sentinels allowe d him to go they had already heard
about the sorcerer who could turn himself into the wind and they
didnt want to go near him In any case the desert was impassable
He spent the entire afternoon  of the second day looking out over
the desert and listening to his heart The boy knew the desert
sensed his fear 
They both spoke the same language
On the third day the chief met with his officers He called the
alchemist to the meeting and said Lets go see the boy who turns
himself into the wind
Lets the alchemist answered

===== Page 110 =====
The boy took them to the cliff where he had been on the previous
day He told them all to be seated
Its going to take awhile the boy said
Were in no hurry  the chief answered We are men of the
desert
The boy looked out at the horizon There were mountain s in the
distance And there were dunes rocks and plants that insisted on
living where survival seemed impossible There was the desert that
he had wandered for so many months despite all that time he knew
only a small part of it Within that small part he had found an
Englishman caravans tribal wars and an oasis with fifty thousand
palm trees and three hundred wells
What do you want here today the desert asked him Didnt you
spend enough time looking at me yesterday
Somewhere you are holding the person I love the boy said So
when I look out over your sands I am also looking at her I want to
return to her and I need your help so that I can turn myself into the
wind
What is love the desert asked
Love is the falcon s flight over your sands Because for him you
are a green field from which he always returns with game He knows
your rocks your dunes and your mountains and you are generous
to him
The falcon s beak carries bits of me myself the desert said For
years I care for his game feeding it with the little water that I have
and then I show him where the game is And one day as I enjoy the
fact that his game thrives on my surface the falcon dives out of the
sky and takes away what Ive created

===== Page 111 =====
But thats why you created the game in the first place the boy
answered To nourish the falcon And the falcon then nourishes
man And eventually  man will nourish your sands where the game
will once again flourish That s how the world goes
So is that what love is
Yes thats what love is Its what makes the game become the
falcon the falcon become man and man in his turn the desert Its
what turns lead into gold and makes the gold return to the earth
I dont understand what youre talking about the desert said 
But you can at least unders tand that somewhere in your sands
there is a woman waiting for me And thats why I have to turn myself
into the wind
The desert didnt answer him for a few moments
Then it told him Ill give you my sands to help the wind to blow
but alone I cant do anything You have to ask for help from the
wind
A breez e began to blow The tribesmen watched the boy from a
distance talking among themselves in a language that the boy
couldnt understand
The alchemist smiled
The wind approached the boy and touched his face It knew of the
boys talk with the desert because the winds know everything They
blow across the world without a birthplace and with no place to die
Help me the boy said One day you carried the voice of my
loved one to me
Who taught you to speak the language of the desert and the
wind
My heart the boy answered
The wind has many names In that part of the world it was called
the sirocco because it broug ht moisture from the oceans to the east
In the distant land the boy came from they called it the levanter 
because they believed that it brought with it the sands of the desert
and the scream s of the Moori sh wars Perhaps in the places beyond
the pastures where his sheep lived men thought that the wind came
from Andalusia But actually  the wind came from no place at all nor
did it go to any place thats why it was stronger than the desert

===== Page 112 =====
Someone might one day plant trees in the desert and even raise
sheep there but never would they harness the wind
You cant be the wind the wind said Were two very different
things
That s not true the boy said I learned the alchemist s secrets in
my travels I have inside me the winds the deserts the oceans the
stars and everything created in the universe We were all made by
the same hand  and we have the same soul I want to be like you
able to reach every corner of the world cross the seas blow away
the sands that cover my treas ure and carry the voice of the woman I
love
I heard what you were talking about the other day with the
alchemist the wind said He said that everything has its own
Personal Legend But people cant turn themselves into the wind
Just teach me to be the wind for a few moments the boy said
So you and I can talk about  the limitless possibilities of people and
the winds
The wind s curiosity was aroused something that had never
happened before It wanted to talk about those things but it didnt
know how to turn a man into the wind And look how many things the
wind already knew how to do It created deserts sank ships felled
entire forests and blew through cities filled with music and strange
noises It felt that it had no limits yet here was a boy saying that
there were other things the wind should be able to do
This is what we call love the boy said seeing that the wind was
close to granting what he requested When you are loved you can
do anything in creation When you are loved there s no need at all to
understand whats happenin g because everything happ ens within
you and even men can turn themselves into the wind As long as the
wind helps of course
The wind was a proud being and it was becoming irritated with
what the boy was saying It commenced to blow harder  raising the
desert sands But finally it had to recognize that even making its
way around the world it didnt know how to turn a man into the wind
And it knew nothing about love
In my travels around the world Ive often seen people speaking
of love and looking toward the heavens the wind said  furious at

===== Page 113 =====
having to acknowledge its own limitations Maybe its better to ask
heaven
Well then help me do that the boy said Fill this place with a
sandstorm so strong that it blots out the sun Then I can look to
heaven without blinding myself
So the wind blew with all its strength and the sky was filled with
sand The sun was turned into a golden disk
At the camp it was difficult to see anything The men of the desert
were already familiar with that wind They called it the simum  and it
was worse than a storm at sea Their horses cried out and all their
weapons were filled with sand
On the heights one of the commanders turned to the chief and
said Maybe we had better end this
They could barely see the boy Their faces were covered with the
blue cloths and their eyes showed fear 
Lets stop this another commander said
I want to see the greatness of Allah the chief said with respect
I want to see how a man turns himself into the wind
But he made a mental note of the names of the two men who had
expressed their fear As soon  as the wind stopped he was going to
remove them from their commands because true men of the desert
are not afraid
The wind told me that you know about love the boy said to the
sun If you know about love you must also know about the Soul of
the W orld because it s made of love 
From where I am the sun said I can see the Soul of the World
It comm unicates with my soul and together we cause the plants to
grow and the sheep to seek out shade From where I amand Im a
long way from the earthI learned how to love I know that if I came
even a little bit closer to the earth everything there would die and
the Soul of the W orld would no longer exist So we contemplate each
other  and we want each other and I give it life and warmth and it
gives me my reason for living
So you know about love the boy said
And I know the Soul of the World because we have talked at
great length to each other during this endless trip through the
universe It tells me that its greatest problem is that up until now

===== Page 114 =====
only the minerals and vegetables understand that all things are one
That there s no need for iron to be the same as copper  or copper the
same as gold Each performs its own exact function as a unique
being and everything would be a symphony of peace if the hand that
wrote all this had stopped on the fifth day of creation
But there was a sixth day  the sun went on
You are wise because you observe everything from a distance
the boy said But you dont know about love If there hadnt been a
sixth day man would not exist copper would always be just copper 
and lead just lead Its true that everything has its Person al Legend
but one day that Personal Legend will be realized So each thing has
to transform itself into something better  and to acquire a new
Personal Legend until someday  the Soul of the World becomes
one thing only 
The sun thought about that and decided to shine more brightly 
The wind which was enjoyin g the conversation started to blow with
greater force so that the sun would not blind the boy 
This is why alchemy exists the boy said So that everyone will
search for his treasure find it and then want to be better than he
was in his former life Lead will play its role until the world has no
further need for lead and then lead will have to turn itself into gold
That s what alchemists do They show that when we strive to
become better than we are everything around us becomes better 
too
Well why did you say that I dont know about love the sun
asked the boy 
Because its not love to be static like the desert nor is it love to
roam the world like the wind And its not love to see everything from
a distance like you do Love is the force that transforms and
improves the Soul of the World When I first reached through to it I
thought the Soul of the World was perfect But later I could see that
it was like other aspects of creation and had its own passions and
wars It is we who nourish the Soul of the World and the world we
live in will be either better or worse depending on whether we
become better  or worse And thats where the power of love comes
in Because when we love we always strive to become better than
we are

===== Page 115 =====
So what do you want of me the sun asked
I want you to help me turn myself into the wind the boy
answered
Nature knows  me as the wisest being in creation the sun said
But I dont know how to turn you into the wind
Then whom should I ask
The sun thought for a minute  The wind was listening closely  and
wanted to tell every corner of the world that the suns wisdom had its
limitations That it was unab le to deal with this boy who spoke the
Language of the W orld
Speak to the hand that wrote all said the sun
The wind screamed with delight and blew harder than ever The
tents were being blown from their ties to the earth and the animals
were being freed from their tethers On the cliff the men clutched at
each other as they sought to keep from being blown away 
The boy turned to the hand that wrote all As he did so he sensed
that the universe had fallen silent and he decided not to speak 
A current of love rushed from his heart and the boy began to
pray It was a prayer that he had never said before because it was a
prayer without words or pleas His prayer didnt give thanks for his
sheep having found new pastures it didnt ask that the boy be able
to sell more crystal and it didnt beseech that the woman he had met
continue to await his return In the silence the boy understood that
the desert the wind and the sun were also trying to understand the
signs written by the hand and were seeking to follow their paths
and to understand what had been written on a single emerald He
saw that omens were scattered throughout the earth and in space
and that there was no reason or significance attache d to their
appearance he could see that not the deserts nor the winds nor the
sun nor peopl e knew why they had been created But that the hand
had a reason for all of this and that only the hand could perform
miracles or transform the sea into a desert    or a man into the
wind Because only the hand understood that it was a larger design
that had moved the univers e to the point at which six days of
creation had evolved into a Master W ork
The boy reached through to the Soul of the World and saw that it
was a part of the Soul of God And he saw that the Soul of God was

===== Page 116 =====
his own soul And that he a boy  could perform miracles
The simum  blew that day as it had never blown before For
generations thereafter  the Arabs recounted the legend of a boy who
had turned himself into the wind almost destroying a military camp
in defiance of the most powerful chief in the desert
When the simum  ceased to blow everyone looked to the place
where the boy had been But he was no longer there he was
standing next to a sandcovered sentinel on the far side of the
camp
The men were terrified at his sorcery  But there were two people
who were smiling the alchem ist because he had found his perfect
disciple and the chief beca use that disciple had understood the
glory of God
The following day the general bade the boy and the alchemist
farewell and provided them with an escort party to accompany them
as far as they chose
They rode for the entire day Toward the end of the afternoon they
came upon a Coptic monastery  The alchemist dismounte d and told
the escorts they could return to the camp
From here on you will be alone the alchemist said You are
only three hours from the Pyramids 
Thank you said the boy You taught me the Language of the
World
I only invoked what you already knew

===== Page 117 =====
The alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery  A monk
dressed in black came to the gates They spoke for a few minutes in
the Coptic tongue and the alchemist bade the boy enter 
I asked  him to let me use the kitchen for a while the alchemist
smiled
They went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery  The
alchemist lighted the fire and the monk brought him some lead
which the alchemist placed in an iron pan When the lead had
become liquid  the alchemist took from his pouch the strange yellow
egg He scraped from it a sliver as thin as a hair wrapped it in wax
and added it to the pan in which the lead had melted
The mixture took on a reddish color  almost the color of blood The
alchemist removed the pan from the fire and set it aside to cool As
he did so he talked with the monk about the tribal wars
I think theyre going to last for a long time he said to the monk
The monk was irritated The caravans had been stopped at Giza
for some time  waiting for the wars to end But God s will be done
the monk said
Exactly  answered the alchemist 
When the pan had cooled the monk and the boy looked at it
dazzled The lead had dried into the shape of the pan but it was no
longer lead It was gold
Will I learn to do that someday the boy asked
This was my Personal Legend not yours the alchemist
answered But I wanted to show you that it was possible
They returned to the gates of the monastery  There the alchemist
separated the disk into four parts

===== Page 118 =====
This is for you he said holding one of the parts out to the monk
Its for your generosity to the pilgrims
But this payment goes well beyond my generosity  the monk
responded
Dont say that again Life might be listening and give you less the
next time
The alchemist turned to the boy This is for you To make up for
what you gave to the general
The boy was about to say that it was much more than he had
given the gene ral But he kept quiet because he had heard what the
alchemist said to the monk
And this is for me said the alchemist keeping one of the parts
Because I have to return to the desert where there are tribal wars 
He took the fourth part and handed it to the monk
This is for the boy  If he ever needs it
But Im going in search of my treasure the boy said Im very
close to it now 
And Im certain youll find it the alchemist said
Then why this
Because you have already lost your savings twice Once to the
thief and once to the general Im an old superstitious Arab and I
believe in our proverbs Theres one that says Everything that
happens once can never happen again But everything that happens
twice will surely happen a third time They mounted their horses
I want to tell you a story about dreams said the alchemist
The boy brought his horse closer 
In ancient Rome at the time of Emperor Tiberius there  lived a
good man who had two sons One was in the military  and had been
sent to the most distant regions of the empire The other son was a
poet and delighted all of Rome with his beautiful verses
One night the father had a dream An angel appeared  to him
and told him that the words of one of his sons would be learned and
repeated throughout the world for all generations to come The father
woke from his dream grateful  and crying because life was generous

===== Page 119 =====
and had revealed to him something any father would be proud to
know 
Shortly therea fter the father died as he tried to save a child who
was about to be crushed by the wheels of a chariot Since he had
lived his entire life in a manner that was correct and fair he went
directly to heaven where he met the angel that had appeared in his
dream
You were always a good man the angel said to him You lived
your life in a loving way and died with dignity  I can now grant you
any wish you desire
Life was good to me the man said When you appeared in my
dream I felt that all my efforts had been rewarded because my
sons poems will be read by men for generations to come I dont
want anything for myself But any father would be proud of the fame
achieved by one whom he had cared for as a child and educated as
he grew up Sometime in the distant future I would like to see my
sons words
The angel touched the mans shoulder  and they were both
projected far into the future  They were in an immen se setting
surrounded by thousands of people speaking a strange language 
The man wept with happiness
I knew that my sons poems were immortal he said to the angel
through his tears Can you please tell me which of my sons poems
these people are repeating
The angel came closer to the man and with tenderness led him
to a bench nearby  where they sat down
The verses of your son who was the poet were very popular in
Rome the angel said Everyone loved them and enjoyed them But
when the reign of Tiberius ended his poems were forgotten The
words youre hearing now are those of your son in the military 
The man looked at the angel in surprise
Your son went to serve at a distant place and became a
centurion He was just and good One afternoon one of his servants
fell ill and it appeared that he would die Your son had heard of a
rabbi who was able to cure illnesses and he rode out for days and
days in search of this man Along the way he learned that the man
he was seekin g was the Son of God He met others who had been

===== Page 120 =====
cured by him and they instructed your son in the man s teachings
And so despite the fact that he was a Roman centurion he
converted to their faith Shortly thereafter  he reached  the place
where the man he was looking for was visiting 
He told the man that one of his servants was gravely ill and the
rabbi made ready to go to his house with him But the centurion was
a man of faith and looking into the eyes of the rabbi he knew that
he was surely in the presence of the Son of God
And this is what your son said the angel told the man These
are the words he said to the rabbi at that point and they have never
been forgotten My Lord I am not worthy that you should come
under my roof But only speak a word and my servant will be
healed 
The alchemist  said No matter what he does every person on
earth plays a central role in the history of the world And normally he
doesnt know it
The boy smiled He had never imagined that questions about life
would be of such importance to a shepherd
Goodbye the alchemist said
Goodbye said the boy 
The boy rode along through  the desert for several hours listening
avidly to what his heart had to say It was his heart that would tell
him where his treasure was hidden 
Where your treasure is there also will be your heart the
alchemist had told him
But his heart was speaking of other things With pride it told the
story of a shepherd who had left his flock to follow a dream he had
on two differen t occasions It told of Personal Legend and of the
many men who had wandered in search of distant lands or beautiful
women confro nting the people of their times with their preconceived
notions It spoke of journeys discoveries books and change
As he was about to climb yet another dune his heart whispered
Be aware of the place where you are brought to tears Thats where
I am and that s where your treasure is

===== Page 121 =====
The boy climb ed the dune slowly  A full moon rose again in the
starry sky it had been a month since he had set forth from the oasis
The moonlight cast shadows through the dunes creating the
appearance of a rolling sea it reminded the boy of the day when that
horse had reared in the desert and he had come to know the
alchemist And the moon fell on the desert s silence and on a man s
journey in search of treasure
When he reached the top of the dune his heart leapt There
illuminated by the light of the moon and the brightness of the desert
stood the solemn and majestic Pyramids of Egypt
The boy fell to his knees and wept He thanked God for making
him believe in his Personal Legend and for leading him to meet a
king a merchant an English man and an alchemist And above all
for his having met a woman of the desert who had told him that love
would never keep a man from his Personal Legend
If he wanted to he could now return to the oasis go back to
Fatima and live his life as a simple shepherd After all the alchemist
continued to live in the desert even though he understood the
Language of the World and knew how to transform lead into gold
He didnt need to demonstra te his science and art to anyone The
boy told himself that on the way toward realizing his own Personal
Legend he had learned all he needed to know  and had experienced
everything he might have dreamed of
But here he was at the point of finding his treasure and he
reminded himself that no project is completed until its objective has
been achieved The boy looked at the sands around him and saw
that where his tears had fallen a scarab beetle was scuttling
through the sand During his time in the desert he had learned that
in Egypt the scarab beetles are a symbol of God
Another omen The boy began to dig into the dune As he did so
he thought of what the crystal merchant had once said that anyone

===== Page 122 =====
could build a pyramid in his backyard The boy could see now that
he couldnt do so if he placed stone upon stone for the rest of his life 
Throughout the night the boy dug at the place he had chosen but
found nothing He felt weighted down by the centuries of time since
the Pyramids had been built But he didnt stop He struggled to
continue digging as he fought the wind which often blew the sand
back into the excavation His hands were abraded and exhausted
but he listened to his heart It had told him to dig where his tears fell
As he was attempting to pull out the rocks he encounte red he
heard footsteps Several figures approached him Their backs were
to the moonlight and the boy could see neither their eyes nor their
faces
What are you doing here one of the figures demanded
Because he was terrified the boy didnt answer  He had found
where his treasure was and was frightened at what might happen
Were refugee s from the tribal wars and we need money the
other figure said What are you hiding there
Im not hiding anything the boy answered
But one of them seized the boy and yanked him back out of the
hole Another  who was searching the boys bags found the piece of
gold
There s gold here he said
The moon shone on the face of the Arab who had seized him and
in the man s eyes the boy saw death 
Hes probably got more gold hidden in the ground
They made the boy continue digging but he found nothing  As the
sun rose the men began to beat the boy He was bruised and
bleeding his clothing was torn to shreds and he felt that death was
near
What good is money to you if youre going to die Its not often
that money can save someone s life the alchemist had said Finally 
the boy screamed at the men Im digging for treasure And
although his mouth was bleeding and swollen he told his attackers
that he had twice dreamed of a treasure hidden near the Pyramids of
Egypt
The man who appeared to be the leader of the group spoke to
one of the others Leave him He doesnt have anythin g else He

===== Page 123 =====
must have stolen this gold
The boy fell to the sand nearly unconscious The leader shook
him and said W ere leaving
But before they left he came  back to the boy and said Youre not
going to die Youll live and youll learn that a man shouldnt be so
stupid Two years ago right here on this spot I had a recurrent
dream too I dreamed that I should travel to the fields of Spain and
look for a ruined church where shepherds and their shee p slept In
my dream there was a sycamore growing out of the ruins of the
sacristy  and I was told that if I dug at the roots of the sycamore I
would find a hidden treasure But Im not so stupid as to cross an
entire desert just because of a recurrent dream
And they disappeared
The boy stood up shakily  and looked once more at the Pyramids
They seemed to laugh at him and he laughed back  his heart
bursting with joy 
Because now he knew where his treasure was

===== Page 124 =====
Epilogue
The boy reached the small  abandoned church just as night was
falling The sycamore was still there in the sacristy  and the stars
could still be seen through the halfdestroyed roof He remembered
the time he had been there with his sheep it had been a peaceful
night    except for the dream
Now he was here not with his flock but with a shovel
He sat looking at the sky for a long time Then he took from his
knapsack a bottle of wine and drank some He remembered the
night in the desert when he had sat with the alchemist as they
looked at the stars and drank wine together  He thought of the many
roads he had traveled and of the strange way God had chosen to
show him his treasure If he hadnt believed in the significance of
recurrent dreams he would not have met the Gypsy woman the
king the thief or    Well its a long list But the path was written in
the omens and there was no way I could go wrong he said to
himself
He fell asleep  and when he awoke the sun was already high He
began to dig at the base of the sycamore
You old sorce rer the boy shouted up to the sky You knew the
whole story You even left a bit of gold at the monastery  so I could
get back to this church The monk laughed when he saw me come
back in tatters Couldnt you have saved me from that
No he heard a voice on the wind say If I had told you you
wouldnt have seen the Pyramids Theyre beautiful arent they
The boy smiled and contin ued digging Half an hour later his
shovel hit something solid An hour later he had before him a chest
of Span ish gold coins There were also precious stones gold masks
adorned with red and white feathers and stone statues embedded
with jewels The spoils of a conquest that the country had long ago

===== Page 125 =====
forgotten and that some conquistador had failed to tell his children
about
The boy took out Urim and Thummim from his bag He had used
the two stones only once  one morning when he was at a
marketplace His life and his path had always provided him with
enough omens
He placed Urim and Thummim  in the chest They were also a part
of his new treasure because  they were a reminder of the old king
whom he would never see again
Its true life really is generous to those who pursue their Personal
Legend the boy thought Then he remembered that he had to get to
Tarifa so he could give onetenth of his treasure to the Gypsy
woman as he had promised Those Gypsies are really smart he
thought Maybe it was because they moved around so much
The wind began to blow again It was the levanter  the wind that
came from Africa It didnt bring with it the smell of the desert nor the
threat of Moorish invasion Instead it brought the scent of a perfume
he knew well and the touch of a kissa kiss that came from far
away  slowly  slowly  until it rested on his lips
The boy smiled It was the first time she had done that
Im coming Fatima he said

Warrior of the Light
PROLOGUE
Just off the beach to the west of the village lies an island and on it
is a vast temple with many bells said the woman
The boy noticed that she was dressed strangely and had a veil
covering her head He had never seen her before
Have you ever visited that temple she asked Go there and tell
me what you think of it
Seduced by the woman s beauty  the boy went to the place she
had indicated  He sat down  on the beach and stared out at the
horizon but he saw only what he always saw blue sky and ocean
Disappointed he walked to a nearby fishing village and asked if
anyone there knew about an island and a temple
Oh that was many years ago when my greatgrandparents were
alive said an old fisherman  There was an earthquake and the
island was swallowed up by the sea But although we can no longer
see the island  we can still hear the temple bells when the ocean
sets them swinging down below 
The boy went back to the beach and tried to hear the bells He
spent the whole afternoon there but all he heard was the noise of
the waves and the cries of the seagulls
When night fell his parents came looking for him The following
morning he went back to the beach he could not believe that such a
beautiful woman would have lied to him If she ever returned he
could tell her that although he had not seen the island he had heard
the temple bells set ringing by the motion of the waves
Many months passed the woman did not return and the boy
forgot all about her now he was convinced that he needed to
discover the riches and treasures in the submerged temple If he

===== Page 128 =====
could hear the bells he would be able to locate it and salvage the
treasure hidden below 
He lost interes t in school and even in his friends He became the
butt of all the other children s jokes They used to say Hes not like
us He prefers to sit looking at the sea because hes afraid of being
beaten in our games
And they all laughed to see the boy sitting on the shore
Although he still could not hear the old temple bells ringing the
boy learned about other things He began to realize that he had
grown so used to the sound of the waves that he was no longer
distracted by them Soon after that he became used to the cries of
the seagulls the buzzing of the bees and the wind blowing amongst
the palm trees
Six months after his first conversation with the woman the boy
could sit there oblivious to all other noises but he still could not hear
the bells from the drowned temple
Fishermen came and talked to him insisting that they had heard
the bells
But the boy never did
Some time later however  the fishermen changed their tune You
spend far too much time thinking about the bells beneath the sea
Forget about them and go back to playing with your friends Perhaps
its only fishermen who can hear them
After almost a year the boy thought Perhaps theyre right I
would do bette r to grow up and become a fisherman and come down
to this beach every morning because Ive come to love it here And
he thought too Perhaps its just another legend and the bells were
all shattered during the earthquake and have never rung out since
That afternoon he decided to go back home
He walked down to the ocean to say goodbye He looked once
more at the natural world around him and because he was no longer
concerned about the bells he could again smile at the beauty of the
seagulls cries  the roar of the sea and the wind blowing in the palm
trees Far off he heard the sound of his friends playing and he felt
glad to think that he would soon resume his childhood games
The boy was happy andas  only a child canhe felt grateful for
being alive He was sure that he had not wasted his time  for he had

===== Page 129 =====
learned to contemplate Nature and to respect it
Then because he was listening to the sea the seagulls the wind
in the palm trees and the voices of his friends playing he also heard
the first bell
And then another 
And another  until to his great joy all the bells in the drowned
temple were ringing
Years later when he was a grown man he returned to the village
and to the beach of his childhood He no longer dreamed of finding
treasure at the bottom of the sea perhaps that had all been a
product of his imagination and he had never really heard the
submerged bells ring out on one lost childhood afternoon Even so
he decided to walk for a while  along the beach to listen to the noise
of the wind and to the cries of the seagulls
Imagine his surprise when  there on the beach he saw the
woman who had first spoken to him about the island and its temple
What are you doing here he asked
I was waiting for you she replied
He noticed that despite the passing years the woman looked
exactly the same the veil hiding her hair had not faded with time
She handed him a blue notebook full of blank pages
Write A Warrior of the Light values a child s eyes because they
are able to look at the world  without bitterness When he wants to
find out if the person beside him is worthy of his trust he tries to see
him as a child would
What is a W arrior of the Light
You already know that she replied with a smile He is someone
capable of understanding the miracle of life of fighting to the last for
something he believes ina nd of hearing the bells that the waves
set ringing on the seabed
He had never thought of himself as a Warrior of the Light The
woman seemed to read his thoughts Everyone is capable of these
things And though no one thinks of himself as a Warrior of the
Light we all are
He looked at the blank pages in the notebook The woman smiled
again
Write about the W arrior  she said
