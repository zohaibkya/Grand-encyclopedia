Chapter 
It was a bright cold day in April and the clocks were striking thirteen Winston
Smith his chin nuzzled into his breast in an eort to escape the vile wind slipped
quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions though not quickly enough
to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him
The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats At one end of it a
coloured poster too large for indoor display had been tacked to the wall It
depicted simply an enormous face more than a metre wide the face of a man of
about fortyve with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features
Winston made for the stairs It was no use trying the lift Even at the best
of times it was seldom working and at present the electric current was cut o
during daylight hours It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate
Week The at was seven ights up and Winston who was thirtynine and had
a varicose ulcer above his right ankle went slowly resting several times on the
way On each landing opposite the liftshaft the poster with the enormous face
gazed from the wall It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that
the eyes follow you about when you move BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING
YOU the caption beneath it ran
Inside the at a fruity voice was reading out a list of gures which had
something to do with the production of pigiron The voice came from an
oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the
righthand wall Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat though
the words were still distinguishable The instrument the telescreen it was
called could be dimmed but there was no way of shutting it o completely He
moved over to the window a smallish frail gure the meagreness of his body
merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party
His hair was very fair his face naturally sanguine his skin roughened by coarse
soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended
Outside even through the shut windowpane the world looked cold Down
in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals
and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue there seemed to be
no colour in anything except the posters that were plastered everywhere The
blackmoustachiod face gazed down from every commanding corner There was
one on the housefront immediately opposite BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING
YOU the caption said while the dark eyes looked deep into Winstons own
Down at streetlevel another poster torn at one corner apped tfully in the
wind alternately covering and uncovering the single word INGSOC In the far
distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs hovered for an instant

like a bluebottle and darted away again with a curving ight It was the police
patrol snooping into peoples windows The patrols did not matter however
Only the Thought Police mattered
Behind Winstons back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away
about pigiron and the overfullment of the Ninth ThreeYear Plan The tele
screen received and transmitted simultaneously Any sound that Winston made
above the level of a very low whisper would be picked up by it moreover so long
as he remained within the eld of vision which the metal plaque commanded he
could be seen as well as heard There was of course no way of knowing whether
you were being watched at any given moment How often or on what system
the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork It was
even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time But at any rate
they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to You had to live  did
live from habit that became instinct  in the assumption that every sound you
made was overheard and except in darkness every movement scrutinized
Winston kept his back turned to the telescreen It was safer though as
he well knew even a back can be revealing A kilometre away the Ministry of
Truth his place of work towered vast and white above the grimy landscape
This he thought with a sort of vague distaste  this was London chief city
of Airstrip One itself the third most populous of the provinces of Oceania
He tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him whether
London had always been quite like this Were there always these vistas of
rotting nineteenthcentury houses their sides shored up with baulks of timber
their windows patched with cardboard and their roofs with corrugated iron
their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions And the bombed sites where
the plaster dust swirled in the air and the willowherb straggled over the heaps of
rubble and the places where the bombs had cleared a larger patch and there had
sprung up sordid colonies of wooden dwellings like chickenhouses But it was no
use he could not remember nothing remained of his childhood except a series
of brightlit tableaux occurring against no background and mostly unintelligible
The Ministry of Truth  Minitrue in Newspeak  was startlingly dierent
from any other object in sight It was an enormous pyramidal structure of
glittering white concrete soaring up terrace after terrace  metres into the
air From where Winston stood it was just possible to read picked out on its
white face in elegant lettering the three slogans of the Party
WAR IS PEACE
FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH
The Ministry of Truth contained it was said three thousand rooms above
ground level and corresponding ramications below Scattered about London
there were just three other buildings of similar appearance and size So com
pletely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roof of Victory
Mansions you could see all four of them simultaneously They were the homes
of the four Ministries between which the entire apparatus of government was
divided The Ministry of Truth which concerned itself with news entertain
ment education and the ne arts The Ministry of Peace which concerned
itself with war The Ministry of Love which maintained law and order And
the Ministry of Plenty which was responsible for economic aairs Their names
in Newspeak Minitrue Minipax Miniluv and Miniplenty
The Ministry of Love was the really frightening one There were no windows

===== Page 4 =====
in it at all Winston had never been inside the Ministry of Love nor within half
a kilometre of it It was a place impossible to enter except on ocial business
and then only by penetrating through a maze of barbedwire entanglements
steel doors and hidden machinegun nests Even the streets leading up to its
outer barriers were roamed by gorillafaced guards in black uniforms armed
with jointed truncheons
Winston turned round abruptly He had set his features into the expression
of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facing the telescreen
He crossed the room into the tiny kitchen By leaving the Ministry at this time
of day he had sacriced his lunch in the canteen and he was aware that there
was no food in the kitchen except a hunk of darkcoloured bread which had got
to be saved for tomorrows breakfast He took down from the shelf a bottle
of colourless liquid with a plain white label marked VICTORY GIN It gave
o a sickly oily smell as of Chinese ricespirit Winston poured out nearly a
teacupful nerved himself for a shock and gulped it down like a dose of medicine
Instantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes The stu
was like nitric acid and moreover in swallowing it one had the sensation of being
hit on the back of the head with a rubber club The next moment however
the burning in his belly died down and the world began to look more cheerful
He took a cigarette from a crumpled packet marked VICTORY CIGARETTES
and incautiously held it upright whereupon the tobacco fell out on to the oor
With the next he was more successful He went back to the livingroom and sat
down at a small table that stood to the left of the telescreen From the table
drawer he took out a penholder a bottle of ink and a thick quartosized blank
book with a red back and a marbled cover
For some reason the telescreen in the livingroom was in an unusual position
Instead of being placed as was normal in the end wall where it could command
the whole room it was in the longer wall opposite the window To one side
of it there was a shallow alcove in which Winston was now sitting and which
when the ats were built had probably been intended to hold bookshelves By
sitting in the alcove and keeping well back Winston was able to remain outside
the range of the telescreen so far as sight went He could be heard of course
but so long as he stayed in his present position he could not be seen It was
partly the unusual geography of the room that had suggested to him the thing
that he was now about to do
But it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of the
drawer It was a peculiarly beautiful book Its smooth creamy paper a little
yellowed by age was of a kind that had not been manufactured for at least forty
years past He could guess however that the book was much older than that
He had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little junkshop in a slummy
quarter of the town just what quarter he did not now remember and had been
stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire to possess it Party members
were supposed not to go into ordinary shops dealing on the free market it was
called but the rule was not strictly kept because there were various things
such as shoelaces and razor blades which it was impossible to get hold of in any
other way He had given a quick glance up and down the street and then had
slipped inside and bought the book for two dollars fty At the time he was not
conscious of wanting it for any particular purpose He had carried it guiltily
home in his briefcase Even with nothing written in it it was a compromising
possession

===== Page 5 =====
The thing that he was about to do was to open a diary This was not illegal
nothing was illegal since there were no longer any laws but if detected it was
reasonably certain that it would be punished by death or at least by twenty
ve years in a forcedlabour camp Winston tted a nib into the penholder
and sucked it to get the grease o The pen was an archaic instrument seldom
used even for signatures and he had procured one furtively and with some
diculty simply because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper deserved
to be written on with a real nib instead of being scratched with an inkpencil
Actually he was not used to writing by hand Apart from very short notes it was
usual to dictate everything into the speakwrite which was of course impossible
for his present purpose He dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for
just a second A tremor had gone through his bowels To mark the paper was
the decisive act In small clumsy letters he wrote
April th 
He sat back A sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him To
begin with he did not know with any certainty that this was  It must be
round about that date since he was fairly sure that his age was thirtynine and
he believed that he had been born in  or  but it was never possible
nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two
For whom it suddenly occurred to him to wonder was he writing this di
ary For the future for the unborn His mind hovered for a moment round
the doubtful date on the page and then fetched up with a bump against the
Newspeak word doublethink For the rst time the magnitude of what he had
undertaken came home to him How could you communicate with the future
It was of its nature impossible Either the future would resemble the present
in which case it would not listen to him or it would be dierent from it and
his predicament would be meaningless
For some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper The telescreen had
changed over to strident military music It was curious that he seemed not
merely to have lost the power of expressing himself but even to have forgotten
what it was that he had originally intended to say For weeks past he had been
making ready for this moment and it had never crossed his mind that anything
would be needed except courage The actual writing would be easy All he had
to do was to transfer to paper the interminable restless monologue that had
been running inside his head literally for years At this moment however even
the monologue had dried up Moreover his varicose ulcer had begun itching
unbearably He dared not scratch it because if he did so it always became
inamed The seconds were ticking by He was conscious of nothing except the
blankness of the page in front of him the itching of the skin above his ankle
the blaring of the music and a slight booziness caused by the gin
Suddenly he began writing in sheer panic only imperfectly aware of what
he was setting down His small but childish handwriting straggled up and down
the page shedding rst its capital letters and nally even its full stops
April th  Last night to the icks All war lms One very good
one of a ship full of refugees being bombed somewhere in the Mediterranean
Audience much amused by shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim away
with a helicopter after him rst you saw him wallowing along in the water like a
porpoise then you saw him through the helicopters gunsights then he was full
of holes and the sea round him turned pink and he sank as suddenly as though
the holes had let in the water audience shouting with laughter when he sank

===== Page 6 =====
then you saw a lifeboat full of children with a helicopter hovering over it there
was a middleaged woman might have been a jewess sitting up in the bow with
a little boy about three years old in her arms little boy screaming with fright
and hiding his head between her breasts as if he was trying to burrow right into
her and the woman putting her arms round him and comforting him although
she was blue with fright herself all the time covering him up as much as possible
as if she thought her arms could keep the bullets o him then the helicopter
planted a  kilo bomb in among them terric ash and the boat went all to
matchwood then there was a wonderful shot of a childs arm going up up up
right up into the air a helicopter with a camera in its nose must have followed
it up and there was a lot of applause from the party seats but a woman down in
the prole part of the house suddenly started kicking up a fuss and shouting they
didnt oughter of showed it not in front of kids they didnt it aint right not in front
of kids it aint until the police turned her turned her out i dont suppose anything
happened to her nobody cares what the proles say typical prole reaction they
never
Winston stopped writing partly because he was suering from cramp He
did not know what had made him pour out this stream of rubbish But the
curious thing was that while he was doing so a totally dierent memory had
claried itself in his mind to the point where he almost felt equal to writing
it down It was he now realized because of this other incident that he had
suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary today
It had happened that morning at the Ministry if anything so nebulous could
be said to happen
It was nearly eleven hundred and in the Records Department where Win
ston worked they were dragging the chairs out of the cubicles and grouping
them in the centre of the hall opposite the big telescreen in preparation for
the Two Minutes Hate Winston was just taking his place in one of the middle
rows when two people whom he knew by sight but had never spoken to came
unexpectedly into the room One of them was a girl whom he often passed
in the corridors He did not know her name but he knew that she worked in
the Fiction Department Presumably  since he had sometimes seen her with
oily hands and carrying a spanner she had some mechanical job on one of the
novelwriting machines She was a boldlooking girl of about twentyseven
with thick hair a freckled face and swift athletic movements A narrow scarlet
sash emblem of the Junior AntiSex League was wound several times round
the waist of her overalls just tightly enough to bring out the shapeliness of her
hips Winston had disliked her from the very rst moment of seeing her He
knew the reason It was because of the atmosphere of hockeyelds and cold
baths and community hikes and general cleanmindedness which she managed
to carry about with her He disliked nearly all women and especially the young
and pretty ones It was always the women and above all the young ones who
were the most bigoted adherents of the Party the swallowers of slogans the
amateur spies and nosersout of unorthodoxy But this particular girl gave him
the impression of being more dangerous than most Once when they passed in
the corridor she gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right
into him and for a moment had lled him with black terror The idea had even
crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the Thought Police That it
was true was very unlikely Still he continued to feel a peculiar uneasiness
which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility whenever she was anywhere

near him
The other person was a man named OBrien a member of the Inner Party
and holder of some post so important and remote that Winston had only a
dim idea of its nature A momentary hush passed over the group of people
round the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an Inner Party member ap
proaching OBrien was a large burly man with a thick neck and a coarse
humorous brutal face In spite of his formidable appearance he had a certain
charm of manner He had a trick of resettling his spectacles on his nose which
was curiously disarming  in some indenable way curiously civilized It was a
gesture which if anyone had still thought in such terms might have recalled an
eighteenthcentury nobleman oering his snubox Winston had seen OBrien
perhaps a dozen times in almost as many years He felt deeply drawn to him
and not solely because he was intrigued by the contrast between OBriens ur
bane manner and his prizeghters physique Much more it was because of
a secretly held belief  or perhaps not even a belief merely a hope  that
OBriens political orthodoxy was not perfect Something in his face suggested
it irresistibly And again perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written
in his face but simply intelligence But at any rate he had the appearance of
being a person that you could talk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen
and get him alone Winston had never made the smallest eort to verify this
guess indeed there was no way of doing so At this moment OBrien glanced
at his wristwatch saw that it was nearly eleven hundred and evidently decided
to stay in the Records Department until the Two Minutes Hate was over He
took a chair in the same row as Winston a couple of places away A small
sandyhaired woman who worked in the next cubicle to Winston was between
them The girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind
The next moment a hideous grinding speech as of some monstrous machine
running without oil burst from the big telescreen at the end of the room It
was a noise that set ones teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the back of
ones neck The Hate had started
As usual the face of Emmanuel Goldstein the Enemy of the People had
ashed on to the screen There were hisses here and there among the audi
ence The little sandyhaired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and disgust
Goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once long ago how long ago
nobody quite remembered had been one of the leading gures of the Party
almost on a level with Big Brother himself and then had engaged in counter
revolutionary activities had been condemned to death and had mysteriously
escaped and disappeared The programmes of the Two Minutes Hate varied
from day to day but there was none in which Goldstein was not the principal
gure He was the primal traitor the earliest deler of the Partys purity All
subsequent crimes against the Party all treacheries acts of sabotage heresies
deviations sprang directly out of his teaching Somewhere or other he was still
alive and hatching his conspiracies perhaps somewhere beyond the sea under
the protection of his foreign paymasters perhaps even  so it was occasionally
rumoured  in some hidingplace in Oceania itself
Winstons diaphragm was constricted He could never see the face of Gold
stein without a painful mixture of emotions It was a lean Jewish face with a
great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a small goatee beard  a clever face and
yet somehow inherently despicable with a kind of senile silliness in the long thin
nose near the end of which a pair of spectacles was perched It resembled the

===== Page 8 =====
face of a sheep and the voice too had a sheeplike quality Goldstein was de
livering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrines of the Party  an attack
so exaggerated and perverse that a child should have been able to see through
it and yet just plausible enough to ll one with an alarmed feeling that other
people less levelheaded than oneself might be taken in by it He was abusing
Big Brother he was denouncing the dictatorship of the Party he was demand
ing the immediate conclusion of peace with Eurasia he was advocating freedom
of speech freedom of the Press freedom of assembly freedom of thought he
was crying hysterically that the revolution had been betrayed  and all this
in rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the habitual style of
the orators of the Party and even contained Newspeak words more Newspeak
words indeed than any Party member would normally use in real life And all
the while lest one should be in any doubt as to the reality which Goldsteins
specious claptrap covered behind his head on the telescreen there marched the
endless columns of the Eurasian army  row after row of solidlooking men
with expressionless Asiatic faces who swam up to the surface of the screen and
vanished to be replaced by others exactly similar The dull rhythmic tramp of
the soldiers boots formed the background to Goldsteins bleating voice
Before the Hate had proceeded for thirty seconds uncontrollable exclama
tions of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room The self
satised sheeplike face on the screen and the terrifying power of the Eurasian
army behind it were too much to be borne besides the sight or even the
thought of Goldstein produced fear and anger automatically He was an object
of hatred more constant than either Eurasia or Eastasia since when Oceania
was at war with one of these Powers it was generally at peace with the other
But what was strange was that although Goldstein was hated and despised
by everybody although every day and a thousand times a day on platforms
on the telescreen in newspapers in books his theories were refuted smashed
ridiculed held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were in
spite of all this his inuence never seemed to grow less Always there were
fresh dupes waiting to be seduced by him A day never passed when spies and
saboteurs acting under his directions were not unmasked by the Thought Po
lice He was the commander of a vast shadowy army an underground network
of conspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the State The Brotherhood its
name was supposed to be There were also whispered stories of a terrible book
a compendium of all the heresies of which Goldstein was the author and which
circulated clandestinely here and there It was a book without a title People
referred to it if at all simply as the book But one knew of such things only
through vague rumours Neither the Brotherhood nor the book was a subject
that any ordinary Party member would mention if there was a way of avoiding
it
In its second minute the Hate rose to a frenzy People were leaping up
and down in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in an eort
to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen The little
sandyhaired woman had turned bright pink and her mouth was opening and
shutting like that of a landed sh Even OBriens heavy face was ushed He
was sitting very straight in his chair his powerful chest swelling and quivering
as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave The darkhaired girl
behind Winston had begun crying out Swine Swine Swine and suddenly
she picked up a heavy Newspeak dictionary and ung it at the screen It struck

===== Page 9 =====
Goldsteins nose and bounced o the voice continued inexorably In a lucid
moment Winston found that he was shouting with the others and kicking his
heel violently against the rung of his chair The horrible thing about the Two
Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act a part but on the contrary
that it was impossible to avoid joining in Within thirty seconds any pretence
was always unnecessary A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness a desire
to kill to torture to smash faces in with a sledgehammer seemed to ow
through the whole group of people like an electric current turning one even
against ones will into a grimacing screaming lunatic And yet the rage that
one felt was an abstract undirected emotion which could be switched from one
object to another like the ame of a blowlamp Thus at one moment Winstons
hatred was not turned against Goldstein at all but on the contrary against
Big Brother the Party and the Thought Police and at such moments his heart
went out to the lonely derided heretic on the screen sole guardian of truth and
sanity in a world of lies And yet the very next instant he was at one with the
people about him and all that was said of Goldstein seemed to him to be true
At those moments his secret loathing of Big Brother changed into adoration
and Big Brother seemed to tower up an invincible fearless protector standing
like a rock against the hordes of Asia and Goldstein in spite of his isolation
his helplessness and the doubt that hung about his very existence seemed like
some sinister enchanter capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the
structure of civilization
It was even possible at moments to switch ones hatred this way or that
by a voluntary act Suddenly by the sort of violent eort with which one
wrenches ones head away from the pillow in a nightmare Winston succeeded in
transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the darkhaired girl behind
him Vivid beautiful hallucinations ashed through his mind He would og
her to death with a rubber truncheon He would tie her naked to a stake and
shoot her full of arrows like Saint Sebastian He would ravish her and cut her
throat at the moment of climax Better than before moreover he realized why
it was that he hated her He hated her because she was young and pretty and
sexless because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so because
round her sweet supple waist which seemed to ask you to encircle it with your
arm there was only the odious scarlet sash aggressive symbol of chastity
The Hate rose to its climax The voice of Goldstein had become an actual
sheeps bleat and for an instant the face changed into that of a sheep Then
the sheepface melted into the gure of a Eurasian soldier who seemed to be ad
vancing huge and terrible his submachine gun roaring and seeming to spring
out of the surface of the screen so that some of the people in the front row
actually inched backwards in their seats But in the same moment drawing a
deep sigh of relief from everybody the hostile gure melted into the face of Big
Brother blackhaired blackmoustachiod full of power and mysterious calm
and so vast that it almost lled up the screen Nobody heard what Big Brother
was saying It was merely a few words of encouragement the sort of words that
are uttered in the din of battle not distinguishable individually but restoring
condence by the fact of being spoken Then the face of Big Brother faded away
again and instead the three slogans of the Party stood out in bold capitals
WAR IS PEACE
FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH

===== Page 10 =====
But the face of Big Brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the
screen as though the impact that it had made on everyones eyeballs was too
vivid to wear o immediately The little sandyhaired woman had ung herself
forward over the back of the chair in front of her With a tremulous murmur
that sounded like My Saviour she extended her arms towards the screen
Then she buried her face in her hands It was apparent that she was uttering a
prayer
At this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep slow rhyth
mical chant of BB  BB  over and over again very slowly with a long
pause between the rst B and the seconda heavy murmurous sound some
how curiously savage in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamp
of naked feet and the throbbing of tomtoms For perhaps as much as thirty
seconds they kept it up It was a refrain that was often heard in moments of
overwhelming emotion Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty
of Big Brother but still more it was an act of selfhypnosis a deliberate drown
ing of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise Winstons entrails seemed to
grow cold In the Two Minutes Hate he could not help sharing in the general
delirium but this subhuman chanting of BB  BB always lled him with
horror Of course he chanted with the rest it was impossible to do otherwise
To dissemble your feelings to control your face to do what everyone else was
doing was an instinctive reaction But there was a space of a couple of seconds
during which the expression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed him
And it was exactly at this moment that the signicant thing happened  if
indeed it did happen
Momentarily he caught OBriens eye OBrien had stood up He had taken
o his spectacles and was in the act of resettling them on his nose with his
characteristic gesture But there was a fraction of a second when their eyes
met and for as long as it took to happen Winston knew  yes he knew 
that OBrien was thinking the same thing as himself An unmistakable message
had passed It was as though their two minds had opened and the thoughts were
owing from one into the other through their eyes I am with you OBrien
seemed to be saying to him I know precisely what you are feeling I know all
about your contempt your hatred your disgust But dont worry I am on your
side And then the ash of intelligence was gone and OBriens face was as
inscrutable as everybody elses
That was all and he was already uncertain whether it had happened Such
incidents never had any sequel All that they did was to keep alive in him
the belief or hope that others besides himself were the enemies of the Party
Perhaps the rumours of vast underground conspiracies were true after all 
perhaps the Brotherhood really existed It was impossible in spite of the endless
arrests and confessions and executions to be sure that the Brotherhood was
not simply a myth Some days he believed in it some days not There was no
evidence only eeting glimpses that might mean anything or nothing snatches
of overheard conversation faint scribbles on lavatory walls  once even when
two strangers met a small movement of the hand which had looked as though
it might be a signal of recognition It was all guesswork very likely he had
imagined everything He had gone back to his cubicle without looking at OBrien
again The idea of following up their momentary contact hardly crossed his
mind It would have been inconceivably dangerous even if he had known how to
set about doing it For a second two seconds they had exchanged an equivocal

glance and that was the end of the story But even that was a memorable event
in the locked loneliness in which one had to live
Winston roused himself and sat up straighter He let out a belch The gin
was rising from his stomach
His eyes refocused on the page He discovered that while he sat helplessly
musing he had also been writing as though by automatic action And it was
no longer the same cramped awkward handwriting as before His pen had slid
voluptuously over the smooth paper printing in large neat capitals
DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER
DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER
DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER
DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER
DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER
over and over again lling half a page
He could not help feeling a twinge of panic It was absurd since the writing
of those particular words was not more dangerous than the initial act of opening
the diary but for a moment he was tempted to tear out the spoiled pages and
abandon the enterprise altogether
He did not do so however because he knew that it was useless Whether
he wrote DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER or whether he refrained from writing
it made no dierence Whether he went on with the diary or whether he did
not go on with it made no dierence The Thought Police would get him just
the same He had committed  would still have committed even if he had
never set pen to paper  the essential crime that contained all others in itself
Thoughtcrime they called it Thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be
concealed for ever You might dodge successfully for a while even for years but
sooner or later they were bound to get you
It was always at night  the arrests invariably happened at night The
sudden jerk out of sleep the rough hand shaking your shoulder the lights glaring
in your eyes the ring of hard faces round the bed In the vast majority of cases
there was no trial no report of the arrest People simply disappeared always
during the night Your name was removed from the registers every record of
everything you had ever done was wiped out your onetime existence was denied
and then forgotten You were abolished annihilated vaporized was the usual
word
For a moment he was seized by a kind of hysteria He began writing in a
hurried untidy scrawl
theyll shoot me i dont care theyll shoot me in the back of the neck i dont
care down with big brother they always shoot you in the back of the neck i dont
care down with big brother
He sat back in his chair slightly ashamed of himself and laid down the pen
The next moment he started violently There was a knocking at the door
Already He sat as still as a mouse in the futile hope that whoever it was
might go away after a single attempt But no the knocking was repeated The
worst thing of all would be to delay His heart was thumping like a drum but
his face from long habit was probably expressionless He got up and moved
heavily towards the door

Chapter 
As he put his hand to the doorknob Winston saw that he had left the diary
open on the table DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER was written all over it in
letters almost big enough to be legible across the room It was an inconceivably
stupid thing to have done But he realized even in his panic he had not wanted
to smudge the creamy paper by shutting the book while the ink was wet
He drew in his breath and opened the door Instantly a warm wave of relief
owed through him A colourless crushedlooking woman with wispy hair and
a lined face was standing outside
Oh comrade she began in a dreary whining sort of voice I thought I
heard you come in Do you think you could come across and have a look at our
kitchen sink Its got blocked up and
It was Mrs Parsons the wife of a neighbour on the same oor Mrs was
a word somewhat discountenanced by the Party  you were supposed to call
everyone comrade  but with some women one used it instinctively She
was a woman of about thirty but looking much older One had the impression
that there was dust in the creases of her face Winston followed her down the
passage These amateur repair jobs were an almost daily irritation Victory
Mansions were old ats built in  or thereabouts and were falling to pieces
The plaster aked constantly from ceilings and walls the pipes burst in every
hard frost the roof leaked whenever there was snow the heating system was
usually running at half steam when it was not closed down altogether from
motives of economy Repairs except what you could do for yourself had to be
sanctioned by remote committees which were liable to hold up even the mending
of a windowpane for two years
Of course its only because Tom isnt home said Mrs Parsons vaguely
The Parsons at was bigger than Winstons and dingy in a dierent way
Everything had a battered trampledon look as though the place had just been
visited by some large violent animal Games impedimenta  hockeysticks
boxinggloves a burst football a pair of sweaty shorts turned inside out  lay
all over the oor and on the table there was a litter of dirty dishes and dog
eared exercisebooks On the walls were scarlet banners of the Youth League
and the Spies and a fullsized poster of Big Brother There was the usual
boiledcabbage smell common to the whole building but it was shot through
by a sharper reek of sweat whichone knew this at the rst sni though it was
hard to say how was the sweat of some person not present at the moment In
another room someone with a comb and a piece of toilet paper was trying to
keep tune with the military music which was still issuing from the telescreen

Its the children said Mrs Parsons casting a halfapprehensive glance at
the door They havent been out today And of course
She had a habit of breaking o her sentences in the middle The kitchen
sink was full nearly to the brim with lthy greenish water which smelt worse
than ever of cabbage Winston knelt down and examined the anglejoint of the
pipe He hated using his hands and he hated bending down which was always
liable to start him coughing Mrs Parsons looked on helplessly
Of course if Tom was home hed put it right in a moment she said He
loves anything like that Hes ever so good with his hands Tom is
Parsons was Winstons fellowemployee at the Ministry of Truth He was a
fattish but active man of paralysing stupidity a mass of imbecile enthusiasms 
one of those completely unquestioning devoted drudges on whom more even
than on the Thought Police the stability of the Party depended At thirty
ve he had just been unwillingly evicted from the Youth League and before
graduating into the Youth League he had managed to stay on in the Spies for
a year beyond the statutory age At the Ministry he was employed in some
subordinate post for which intelligence was not required but on the other hand
he was a leading gure on the Sports Committee and all the other committees
engaged in organizing community hikes spontaneous demonstrations savings
campaigns and voluntary activities generally He would inform you with quiet
pride between whis of his pipe that he had put in an appearance at the
Community Centre every evening for the past four years An overpowering
smell of sweat a sort of unconscious testimony to the strenuousness of his life
followed him about wherever he went and even remained behind him after he
had gone
Have you got a spanner said Winston ddling with the nut on the angle
joint
A spanner said Mrs Parsons immediately becoming invertebrate I dont
know Im sure Perhaps the children 
There was a trampling of boots and another blast on the comb as the children
charged into the livingroom Mrs Parsons brought the spanner Winston let
out the water and disgustedly removed the clot of human hair that had blocked
up the pipe He cleaned his ngers as best he could in the cold water from the
tap and went back into the other room
Up with your hands yelled a savage voice
A handsome toughlooking boy of nine had popped up from behind the
table and was menacing him with a toy automatic pistol while his small sister
about two years younger made the same gesture with a fragment of wood Both
of them were dressed in the blue shorts grey shirts and red neckerchiefs which
were the uniform of the Spies Winston raised his hands above his head but
with an uneasy feeling so vicious was the boys demeanour that it was not
altogether a game
Youre a traitor yelled the boy Youre a thoughtcriminal Youre a
Eurasian spy Ill shoot you Ill vaporize you Ill send you to the salt mines
Suddenly they were both leaping round him shouting Traitor and Thought
criminal the little girl imitating her brother in every movement It was some
how slightly frightening like the gambolling of tiger cubs which will soon grow
up into maneaters There was a sort of calculating ferocity in the boys eye
a quite evident desire to hit or kick Winston and a consciousness of being very
nearly big enough to do so It was a good job it was not a real pistol he was

===== Page 14 =====
holding Winston thought
Mrs Parsons eyes itted nervously from Winston to the children and back
again In the better light of the livingroom he noticed with interest that there
actually was dust in the creases of her face
They do get so noisy she said Theyre disappointed because they couldnt
go to see the hanging thats what it is Im too busy to take them and Tom
wont be back from work in time
Why cant we go and see the hanging roared the boy in his huge voice
Want to see the hanging Want to see the hanging chanted the little girl
still capering round
Some Eurasian prisoners guilty of war crimes were to be hanged in the
Park that evening Winston remembered This happened about once a month
and was a popular spectacle Children always clamoured to be taken to see
it He took his leave of Mrs Parsons and made for the door But he had not
gone six steps down the passage when something hit the back of his neck an
agonizingly painful blow It was as though a redhot wire had been jabbed into
him He spun round just in time to see Mrs Parsons dragging her son back into
the doorway while the boy pocketed a catapult
Goldstein bellowed the boy as the door closed on him But what most
struck Winston was the look of helpless fright on the womans greyish face
Back in the at he stepped quickly past the telescreen and sat down at the
table again still rubbing his neck The music from the telescreen had stopped
Instead a clipped military voice was reading out with a sort of brutal relish a
description of the armaments of the new Floating Fortress which had just been
anchored between lceland and the Faroe lslands
With those children he thought that wretched woman must lead a life of
terror Another year two years and they would be watching her night and
day for symptoms of unorthodoxy Nearly all children nowadays were horrible
What was worst of all was that by means of such organizations as the Spies
they were systematically turned into ungovernable little savages and yet this
produced in them no tendency whatever to rebel against the discipline of the
Party On the contrary they adored the Party and everything connected with
it The songs the processions the banners the hiking the drilling with dummy
ries the yelling of slogans the worship of Big Brother  it was all a sort of
glorious game to them All their ferocity was turned outwards against the
enemies of the State against foreigners traitors saboteurs thoughtcriminals
It was almost normal for people over thirty to be frightened of their own children
And with good reason for hardly a week passed in which The Times did not
carry a paragraph describing how some eavesdropping little sneak  child hero
was the phrase generally used  had overheard some compromising remark and
denounced its parents to the Thought Police
The sting of the catapult bullet had worn o He picked up his pen half
heartedly wondering whether he could nd something more to write in the
diary Suddenly he began thinking of OBrien again
Years ago  how long was it Seven years it must be  he had dreamed
that he was walking through a pitchdark room And someone sitting to one
side of him had said as he passed We shall meet in the place where there is
no darkness It was said very quietly almost casually  a statement not a
command He had walked on without pausing What was curious was that at
the time in the dream the words had not made much impression on him It

===== Page 15 =====
was only later and by degrees that they had seemed to take on signicance He
could not now remember whether it was before or after having the dream that
he had seen OBrien for the rst time nor could he remember when he had rst
identied the voice as OBriens But at any rate the identication existed It
was OBrien who had spoken to him out of the dark
Winston had never been able to feel sure  even after this mornings ash
of the eyes it was still impossible to be sure whether OBrien was a friend
or an enemy Nor did it even seem to matter greatly There was a link of
understanding between them more important than aection or partisanship
We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness he had said Winston
did not know what it meant only that in some way or another it would come
true
The voice from the telescreen paused A trumpet call clear and beautiful
oated into the stagnant air The voice continued raspingly
Attention Your attention please A newsash has this moment arrived
from the Malabar front Our forces in South India have won a glorious victory
I am authorized to say that the action we are now reporting may well bring the
war within measurable distance of its end Here is the newsash 
Bad news coming thought Winston And sure enough following on a gory
description of the annihilation of a Eurasian army with stupendous gures
of killed and prisoners came the announcement that as from next week the
chocolate ration would be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty
Winston belched again The gin was wearing o leaving a deated feeling
The telescreen  perhaps to celebrate the victory perhaps to drown the memory
of the lost chocolate  crashed into Oceania tis for thee You were supposed
to stand to attention However in his present position he was invisible
Oceania tis for thee gave way to lighter music Winston walked over to
the window keeping his back to the telescreen The day was still cold and clear
Somewhere far away a rocket bomb exploded with a dull reverberating roar
About twenty or thirty of them a week were falling on London at present
Down in the street the wind apped the torn poster to and fro and the
word INGSOC tfully appeared and vanished Ingsoc The sacred principles of
Ingsoc Newspeak doublethink the mutability of the past He felt as though
he were wandering in the forests of the sea bottom lost in a monstrous world
where he himself was the monster He was alone The past was dead the future
was unimaginable What certainty had he that a single human creature now
living was on his side And what way of knowing that the dominion of the Party
would not endure for ever Like an answer the three slogans on the white face
of the Ministry of Truth came back to him
WAR IS PEACE
FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH
He took a twentyve cent piece out of his pocket There too in tiny clear
lettering the same slogans were inscribed and on the other face of the coin the
head of Big Brother Even from the coin the eyes pursued you On coins on
stamps on the covers of books on banners on posters and on the wrappings of
a cigarette Packet  everywhere Always the eyes watching you and the voice
enveloping you Asleep or awake working or eating indoors or out of doors in
the bath or in bed  no escape Nothing was your own except the few cubic
centimetres inside your skull

===== Page 16 =====
The sun had shifted round and the myriad windows of the Ministry of
Truth with the light no longer shining on them looked grim as the loopholes of
a fortress His heart quailed before the enormous pyramidal shape It was too
strong it could not be stormed A thousand rocket bombs would not batter it
down He wondered again for whom he was writing the diary For the future
for the past  for an age that might be imaginary And in front of him there lay
not death but annihilation The diary would be reduced to ashes and himself
to vapour Only the Thought Police would read what he had written before
they wiped it out of existence and out of memory How could you make appeal
to the future when not a trace of you not even an anonymous word scribbled
on a piece of paper could physically survive
The telescreen struck fourteen He must leave in ten minutes He had to be
back at work by fourteenthirty
Curiously the chiming of the hour seemed to have put new heart into him
He was a lonely ghost uttering a truth that nobody would ever hear But so
long as he uttered it in some obscure way the continuity was not broken It
was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane that you carried on the
human heritage He went back to the table dipped his pen and wrote
To the future or to the past to a time when thought is free when men are
dierent from one another and do not live alone  to a time when truth exists
and what is done cannot be undone
From the age of uniformity from the age of solitude from the age of Big
Brother from the age of doublethink  greetings
He was already dead he reected It seemed to him that it was only now
when he had begun to be able to formulate his thoughts that he had taken the
decisive step The consequences of every act are included in the act itself He
wrote
Thoughtcrime does not entail death thoughtcrime IS death
Now he had recognized himself as a dead man it became important to stay
alive as long as possible Two ngers of his right hand were inkstained It was
exactly the kind of detail that might betray you Some nosing zealot in the
Ministry a woman probably someone like the little sandyhaired woman or
the darkhaired girl from the Fiction Department might start wondering why he
had been writing during the lunch interval why he had used an oldfashioned
pen what he had been writing  and then drop a hint in the appropriate
quarter He went to the bathroom and carefully scrubbed the ink away with
the gritty darkbrown soap which rasped your skin like sandpaper and was
therefore well adapted for this purpose
He put the diary away in the drawer It was quite useless to think of hiding it
but he could at least make sure whether or not its existence had been discovered
A hair laid across the pageends was too obvious With the tip of his nger he
picked up an identiable grain of whitish dust and deposited it on the corner of
the cover where it was bound to be shaken o if the book was moved

Chapter 
Winston was dreaming of his mother
He must he thought have been ten or eleven years old when his mother
had disappeared She was a tall statuesque rather silent woman with slow
movements and magnicent fair hair His father he remembered more vaguely
as dark and thin dressed always in neat dark clothes Winston remembered
especially the very thin soles of his fathers shoes and wearing spectacles The
two of them must evidently have been swallowed up in one of the rst great
purges of the fties
At this moment his mother was sitting in some place deep down beneath
him with his young sister in her arms He did not remember his sister at all
except as a tiny feeble baby always silent with large watchful eyes Both of
them were looking up at him They were down in some subterranean place 
the bottom of a well for instance or a very deep grave  but it was a place
which already far below him was itself moving downwards They were in the
saloon of a sinking ship looking up at him through the darkening water There
was still air in the saloon they could still see him and he them but all the while
they were sinking down down into the green waters which in another moment
must hide them from sight for ever He was out in the light and air while they
were being sucked down to death and they were down there because he was
up here He knew it and they knew it and he could see the knowledge in their
faces There was no reproach either in their faces or in their hearts only the
knowledge that they must die in order that he might remain alive and that this
was part of the unavoidable order of things
He could not remember what had happened but he knew in his dream that in
some way the lives of his mother and his sister had been sacriced to his own It
was one of those dreams which while retaining the characteristic dream scenery
are a continuation of ones intellectual life and in which one becomes aware of
facts and ideas which still seem new and valuable after one is awake The thing
that now suddenly struck Winston was that his mothers death nearly thirty
years ago had been tragic and sorrowful in a way that was no longer possible
Tragedy he perceived belonged to the ancient time to a time when there was
still privacy love and friendship and when the members of a family stood by
one another without needing to know the reason His mothers memory tore at
his heart because she had died loving him when he was too young and selsh
to love her in return and because somehow he did not remember how she had
sacriced herself to a conception of loyalty that was private and unalterable
Such things he saw could not happen today Today there were fear hatred

===== Page 18 =====
and pain but no dignity of emotion no deep or complex sorrows All this he
seemed to see in the large eyes of his mother and his sister looking up at him
through the green water hundreds of fathoms down and still sinking
Suddenly he was standing on short springy turf on a summer evening when
the slanting rays of the sun gilded the ground The landscape that he was looking
at recurred so often in his dreams that he was never fully certain whether or not
he had seen it in the real world In his waking thoughts he called it the Golden
Country It was an old rabbitbitten pasture with a foottrack wandering
across it and a molehill here and there In the ragged hedge on the opposite
side of the eld the boughs of the elm trees were swaying very faintly in the
breeze their leaves just stirring in dense masses like womens hair Somewhere
near at hand though out of sight there was a clear slowmoving stream where
dace were swimming in the pools under the willow trees
The girl with dark hair was coming towards them across the eld With what
seemed a single movement she tore o her clothes and ung them disdainfully
aside Her body was white and smooth but it aroused no desire in him indeed
he barely looked at it What overwhelmed him in that instant was admiration
for the gesture with which she had thrown her clothes aside With its grace
and carelessness it seemed to annihilate a whole culture a whole system of
thought as though Big Brother and the Party and the Thought Police could all
be swept into nothingness by a single splendid movement of the arm That too
was a gesture belonging to the ancient time Winston woke up with the word
Shakespeare on his lips
The telescreen was giving forth an earsplitting whistle which continued on
the same note for thirty seconds It was nought seven fteen gettingup time for
oce workers Winston wrenched his body out of bed  naked for a member
of the Outer Party received only  clothing coupons annually and a suit of
pyjamas was   and seized a dingy singlet and a pair of shorts that were
lying across a chair The Physical Jerks would begin in three minutes The
next moment he was doubled up by a violent coughing t which nearly always
attacked him soon after waking up It emptied his lungs so completely that he
could only begin breathing again by lying on his back and taking a series of
deep gasps His veins had swelled with the eort of the cough and the varicose
ulcer had started itching
Thirty to forty group yapped a piercing female voice  Thirty to forty
group Take your places please Thirties to forties
Winston sprang to attention in front of the telescreen upon which the image
of a youngish woman scrawny but muscular dressed in tunic and gymshoes
had already appeared
Arms bending and stretching she rapped out Take your time by me
One two three four One two three four Come on comrades put a bit of
life into it One two three four One two three four   
The pain of the coughing t had not quite driven out of Winstons mind
the impression made by his dream and the rhythmic movements of the exercise
restored it somewhat As he mechanically shot his arms back and forth wearing
on his face the look of grim enjoyment which was considered proper during the
Physical Jerks he was struggling to think his way backward into the dim period
of his early childhood It was extraordinarily dicult Beyond the late fties
everything faded When there were no external records that you could refer
to even the outline of your own life lost its sharpness You remembered huge

===== Page 19 =====
events which had quite probably not happened you remembered the detail of
incidents without being able to recapture their atmosphere and there were long
blank periods to which you could assign nothing Everything had been dierent
then Even the names of countries and their shapes on the map had been
dierent Airstrip One for instance had not been so called in those days it
had been called England or Britain though London he felt fairly certain had
always been called London
Winston could not denitely remember a time when his country had not
been at war but it was evident that there had been a fairly long interval of
peace during his childhood because one of his early memories was of an air raid
which appeared to take everyone by surprise Perhaps it was the time when
the atomic bomb had fallen on Colchester He did not remember the raid itself
but he did remember his fathers hand clutching his own as they hurried down
down down into some place deep in the earth round and round a spiral staircase
which rang under his feet and which nally so wearied his legs that he began
whimpering and they had to stop and rest His mother in her slow dreamy
way was following a long way behind them She was carrying his baby sister 
or perhaps it was only a bundle of blankets that she was carrying he was not
certain whether his sister had been born then Finally they had emerged into a
noisy crowded place which he had realized to be a Tube station
There were people sitting all over the stoneagged oor and other people
packed tightly together were sitting on metal bunks one above the other Win
ston and his mother and father found themselves a place on the oor and near
them an old man and an old woman were sitting side by side on a bunk The
old man had on a decent dark suit and a black cloth cap pushed back from
very white hair his face was scarlet and his eyes were blue and full of tears
He reeked of gin It seemed to breathe out of his skin in place of sweat and
one could have fancied that the tears welling from his eyes were pure gin But
though slightly drunk he was also suering under some grief that was genuine
and unbearable In his childish way Winston grasped that some terrible thing
something that was beyond forgiveness and could never be remedied had just
happened It also seemed to him that he knew what it was Someone whom the
old man loved  a little granddaughter perhaps had been killed Every few
minutes the old man kept repeating
We didnt ought to ave trusted em I said so Ma didnt I Thats what
comes of trusting em I said so all along We didnt ought to ave trusted the
buggers
But which buggers they didnt ought to have trusted Winston could not now
remember
Since about that time war had been literally continuous though strictly
speaking it had not always been the same war For several months during
his childhood there had been confused street ghting in London itself some of
which he remembered vividly But to trace out the history of the whole period
to say who was ghting whom at any given moment would have been utterly
impossible since no written record and no spoken word ever made mention
of any other alignment than the existing one At this moment for example
in  if it was  Oceania was at war with Eurasia and in alliance with
Eastasia In no public or private utterance was it ever admitted that the three
powers had at any time been grouped along dierent lines Actually as Winston
well knew it was only four years since Oceania had been at war with Eastasia

===== Page 20 =====
and in alliance with Eurasia But that was merely a piece of furtive knowledge
which he happened to possess because his memory was not satisfactorily under
control Ocially the change of partners had never happened Oceania was at
war with Eurasia therefore Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia The
enemy of the moment always represented absolute evil and it followed that any
past or future agreement with him was impossible
The frightening thing he reected for the ten thousandth time as he forced
his shoulders painfully backward with hands on hips they were gyrating their
bodies from the waist an exercise that was supposed to be good for the back
muscles  the frightening thing was that it might all be true If the Party could
thrust its hand into the past and say of this or that event it never happened
 that surely was more terrifying than mere torture and death
The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliance with Eurasia He
Winston Smith knew that Oceania had been in alliance with Eurasia as short
a time as four years ago But where did that knowledge exist Only in his own
consciousness which in any case must soon be annihilated And if all others
accepted the lie which the Party imposed if all records told the same tale 
then the lie passed into history and became truth Who controls the past ran
the Party slogan controls the future who controls the present controls the
past And yet the past though of its nature alterable never had been altered
Whatever was true now was true from everlasting to everlasting It was quite
simple All that was needed was an unending series of victories over your own
memory Reality control they called it in Newspeak doublethink
Stand easy barked the instructress a little more genially
Winston sank his arms to his sides and slowly relled his lungs with air His
mind slid away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink To know and not
to know to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully con
structed lies to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out knowing
them to be contradictory and believing in both of them to use logic against
logic to repudiate morality while laying claim to it to believe that democracy
was impossible and that the Party was the guardian of democracy to forget
whatever it was necessary to forget then to draw it back into memory again
at the moment when it was needed and then promptly to forget it again and
above all to apply the same process to the process itself That was the ulti
mate subtlety consciously to induce unconsciousness and then once again to
become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed Even to
understand the word doublethink involved the use of doublethink
The instructress had called them to attention again And now lets see
which of us can touch our toes she said enthusiastically Right over from the
hips please comrades Onetwo Onetwo 
Winston loathed this exercise which sent shooting pains all the way from
his heels to his buttocks and often ended by bringing on another coughing t
The halfpleasant quality went out of his meditations The past he reected
had not merely been altered it had been actually destroyed For how could
you establish even the most obvious fact when there existed no record outside
your own memory He tried to remember in what year he had rst heard
mention of Big Brother He thought it must have been at some time in the
sixties but it was impossible to be certain In the Party histories of course
Big Brother gured as the leader and guardian of the Revolution since its very
earliest days His exploits had been gradually pushed backwards in time until

===== Page 21 =====
already they extended into the fabulous world of the forties and the thirties
when the capitalists in their strange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets
of London in great gleaming motorcars or horse carriages with glass sides
There was no knowing how much of this legend was true and how much invented
Winston could not even remember at what date the Party itself had come into
existence He did not believe he had ever heard the word Ingsoc before 
but it was possible that in its Oldspeak formEnglish Socialism that is to say
 it had been current earlier Everything melted into mist Sometimes indeed
you could put your nger on a denite lie It was not true for example as was
claimed in the Party history books that the Party had invented aeroplanes
He remembered aeroplanes since his earliest childhood But you could prove
nothing There was never any evidence Just once in his whole life he had held
in his hands unmistakable documentary proof of the falsication of an historical
fact And on that occasion
Smith screamed the shrewish voice from the telescreen  Smith W
Yes you Bend lower please You can do better than that Youre not trying
Lower please Thats better comrade Now stand at ease the whole squad
and watch me
A sudden hot sweat had broken out all over Winstons body His face re
mained completely inscrutable Never show dismay Never show resentment
A single icker of the eyes could give you away He stood watching while the
instructress raised her arms above her head and  one could not say gracefully
but with remarkable neatness and eciency  bent over and tucked the rst
joint of her ngers under her toes
There comrades Thats how I want to see you doing it Watch me again
Im thirtynine and Ive had four children Now look She bent over again
You see my knees arent bent You can all do it if you want to she added
as she straightened herself up Anyone under fortyve is perfectly capable of
touching his toes We dont all have the privilege of ghting in the front line
but at least we can all keep t Remember our boys on the Malabar front And
the sailors in the Floating Fortresses Just think what they have to put up
with Now try again Thats better comrade thats much better she added
encouragingly as Winston with a violent lunge succeeded in touching his toes
with knees unbent for the rst time in several years

Chapter 
With the deep unconscious sigh which not even the nearness of the telescreen
could prevent him from uttering when his days work started Winston pulled
the speakwrite towards him blew the dust from its mouthpiece and put on his
spectacles Then he unrolled and clipped together four small cylinders of paper
which had already opped out of the pneumatic tube on the righthand side of
his desk
In the walls of the cubicle there were three orices To the right of the
speakwrite a small pneumatic tube for written messages to the left a larger
one for newspapers and in the side wall within easy reach of Winstons arm a
large oblong slit protected by a wire grating This last was for the disposal of
waste paper Similar slits existed in thousands or tens of thousands throughout
the building not only in every room but at short intervals in every corridor
For some reason they were nicknamed memory holes When one knew that any
document was due for destruction or even when one saw a scrap of waste paper
lying about it was an automatic action to lift the ap of the nearest memory
hole and drop it in whereupon it would be whirled away on a current of warm
air to the enormous furnaces which were hidden somewhere in the recesses of
the building
Winston examined the four slips of paper which he had unrolled Each
contained a message of only one or two lines in the abbreviated jargon  not
actually Newspeak but consisting largely of Newspeak words  which was used
in the Ministry for internal purposes They ran
times  bb speech malreported africa rectify
times  forecasts  yp th quarter  misprints verify current issue
times  miniplenty malquoted chocolate rectify
times  reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersons rewrite
fullwise upsub anteling
With a faint feeling of satisfaction Winston laid the fourth message aside
It was an intricate and responsible job and had better be dealt with last The
other three were routine matters though the second one would probably mean
some tedious wading through lists of gures
Winston dialled back numbers on the telescreen and called for the appro
priate issues of The Times which slid out of the pneumatic tube after only a
few minutes delay The messages he had received referred to articles or news
items which for one reason or another it was thought necessary to alter or as
the ocial phrase had it to rectify For example it appeared from The Times
of the seventeenth of March that Big Brother in his speech of the previous

===== Page 23 =====
day had predicted that the South Indian front would remain quiet but that a
Eurasian oensive would shortly be launched in North Africa As it happened
the Eurasian Higher Command had launched its oensive in South India and
left North Africa alone It was therefore necessary to rewrite a paragraph of
Big Brothers speech in such a way as to make him predict the thing that had
actually happened Or again The Times of the nineteenth of December had
published the ocial forecasts of the output of various classes of consumption
goods in the fourth quarter of  which was also the sixth quarter of the
Ninth ThreeYear Plan Todays issue contained a statement of the actual out
put from which it appeared that the forecasts were in every instance grossly
wrong Winstons job was to rectify the original gures by making them agree
with the later ones As for the third message it referred to a very simple er
ror which could be set right in a couple of minutes As short a time ago as
February the Ministry of Plenty had issued a promise a categorical pledge
were the ocial words that there would be no reduction of the chocolate ration
during  Actually as Winston was aware the chocolate ration was to be
reduced from thirty grammes to twenty at the end of the present week All that
was needed was to substitute for the original promise a warning that it would
probably be necessary to reduce the ration at some time in April
As soon as Winston had dealt with each of the messages he clipped his
speakwritten corrections to the appropriate copy of The Times and pushed
them into the pneumatic tube Then with a movement which was as nearly as
possible unconscious he crumpled up the original message and any notes that
he himself had made and dropped them into the memory hole to be devoured
by the ames
What happened in the unseen labyrinth to which the pneumatic tubes led
he did not know in detail but he did know in general terms As soon as all the
corrections which happened to be necessary in any particular number of The
Times had been assembled and collated that number would be reprinted the
original copy destroyed and the corrected copy placed on the les in its stead
This process of continuous alteration was applied not only to newspapers but
to books periodicals pamphlets posters leaets lms soundtracks cartoons
photographs  to every kind of literature or documentation which might con
ceivably hold any political or ideological signicance Day by day and almost
minute by minute the past was brought up to date In this way every prediction
made by the Party could be shown by documentary evidence to have been cor
rect nor was any item of news or any expression of opinion which conicted
with the needs of the moment ever allowed to remain on record All history was
a palimpsest scraped clean and reinscribed exactly as often as was necessary In
no case would it have been possible once the deed was done to prove that any
falsication had taken place The largest section of the Records Department
far larger than the one on which Winston worked consisted simply of persons
whose duty it was to track down and collect all copies of books newspapers
and other documents which had been superseded and were due for destruction
A number of The Times which might because of changes in political alignment
or mistaken prophecies uttered by Big Brother have been rewritten a dozen
times still stood on the les bearing its original date and no other copy existed
to contradict it Books also were recalled and rewritten again and again and
were invariably reissued without any admission that any alteration had been
made Even the written instructions which Winston received and which he

===== Page 24 =====
invariably got rid of as soon as he had dealt with them never stated or implied
that an act of forgery was to be committed always the reference was to slips
errors misprints or misquotations which it was necessary to put right in the
interests of accuracy
But actually he thought as he readjusted the Ministry of Plentys gures
it was not even forgery It was merely the substitution of one piece of nonsense
for another Most of the material that you were dealing with had no connexion
with anything in the real world not even the kind of connexion that is contained
in a direct lie Statistics were just as much a fantasy in their original version
as in their rectied version A great deal of the time you were expected to
make them up out of your head For example the Ministry of Plentys forecast
had estimated the output of boots for the quarter at  million pairs The
actual output was given as sixtytwo millions Winston however in rewriting
the forecast marked the gure down to ftyseven millions so as to allow for
the usual claim that the quota had been overfullled In any case sixtytwo
millions was no nearer the truth than ftyseven millions or than  millions
Very likely no boots had been produced at all Likelier still nobody knew
how many had been produced much less cared All one knew was that every
quarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper while perhaps
half the population of Oceania went barefoot And so it was with every class
of recorded fact great or small Everything faded away into a shadowworld in
which nally even the date of the year had become uncertain
Winston glanced across the hall In the corresponding cubicle on the other
side a small preciselooking darkchinned man named Tillotson was working
steadily away with a folded newspaper on his knee and his mouth very close
to the mouthpiece of the speakwrite He had the air of trying to keep what he
was saying a secret between himself and the telescreen He looked up and his
spectacles darted a hostile ash in Winstons direction
Winston hardly knew Tillotson and had no idea what work he was employed
on People in the Records Department did not readily talk about their jobs
In the long windowless hall with its double row of cubicles and its endless
rustle of papers and hum of voices murmuring into speakwrites there were
quite a dozen people whom Winston did not even know by name though he
daily saw them hurrying to and fro in the corridors or gesticulating in the
Two Minutes Hate He knew that in the cubicle next to him the little woman
with sandy hair toiled day in day out simply at tracking down and deleting
from the Press the names of people who had been vaporized and were therefore
considered never to have existed There was a certain tness in this since
her own husband had been vaporized a couple of years earlier And a few
cubicles away a mild ineectual dreamy creature named Ampleforth with
very hairy ears and a surprising talent for juggling with rhymes and metres
was engaged in producing garbled versions  denitive texts they were called
 of poems which had become ideologically oensive but which for one reason
or another were to be retained in the anthologies And this hall with its fty
workers or thereabouts was only one subsection a single cell as it were in
the huge complexity of the Records Department Beyond above below were
other swarms of workers engaged in an unimaginable multitude of jobs There
were the huge printingshops with their subeditors their typography experts
and their elaborately equipped studios for the faking of photographs There was
the teleprogrammes section with its engineers its producers and its teams of

===== Page 25 =====
actors specially chosen for their skill in imitating voices There were the armies
of reference clerks whose job was simply to draw up lists of books and periodicals
which were due for recall There were the vast repositories where the corrected
documents were stored and the hidden furnaces where the original copies were
destroyed And somewhere or other quite anonymous there were the directing
brains who coordinated the whole eort and laid down the lines of policy which
made it necessary that this fragment of the past should be preserved that one
falsied and the other rubbed out of existence
And the Records Department after all was itself only a single branch of
the Ministry of Truth whose primary job was not to reconstruct the past but
to supply the citizens of Oceania with newspapers lms textbooks telescreen
programmes plays novels  with every conceivable kind of information in
struction or entertainment from a statue to a slogan from a lyric poem to a
biological treatise and from a childs spellingbook to a Newspeak dictionary
And the Ministry had not only to supply the multifarious needs of the party
but also to repeat the whole operation at a lower level for the benet of the
proletariat There was a whole chain of separate departments dealing with pro
letarian literature music drama and entertainment generally Here were pro
duced rubbishy newspapers containing almost nothing except sport crime and
astrology sensational vecent novelettes lms oozing with sex and sentimen
tal songs which were composed entirely by mechanical means on a special kind
of kaleidoscope known as a versicator There was even a whole subsection 
Pornosec it was called in Newspeak  engaged in producing the lowest kind of
pornography which was sent out in sealed packets and which no Party member
other than those who worked on it was permitted to look at
Three messages had slid out of the pneumatic tube while Winston was work
ing but they were simple matters and he had disposed of them before the Two
Minutes Hate interrupted him When the Hate was over he returned to his cubi
cle took the Newspeak dictionary from the shelf pushed the speakwrite to one
side cleaned his spectacles and settled down to his main job of the morning
Winstons greatest pleasure in life was in his work Most of it was a tedious
routine but included in it there were also jobs so dicult and intricate that
you could lose yourself in them as in the depths of a mathematical problem
 delicate pieces of forgery in which you had nothing to guide you except
your knowledge of the principles of Ingsoc and your estimate of what the Party
wanted you to say Winston was good at this kind of thing On occasion he had
even been entrusted with the rectication of The Times leading articles which
were written entirely in Newspeak He unrolled the message that he had set
aside earlier It ran
times  reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersons rewrite
fullwise upsub anteling
In Oldspeak or standard English this might be rendered The reporting of
Big Brothers Order for the Day in The Times of December rd  is extremely
unsatisfactory and makes references to nonexistent persons Rewrite it in full
and submit your draft to higher authority before ling
Winston read through the oending article Big Brothers Order for the Day
it seemed had been chiey devoted to praising the work of an organization
known as FFCC which supplied cigarettes and other comforts to the sailors
in the Floating Fortresses A certain Comrade Withers a prominent member
of the Inner Party had been singled out for special mention and awarded a

===== Page 26 =====
decoration the Order of Conspicuous Merit Second Class
Three months later FFCC had suddenly been dissolved with no reasons
given One could assume that Withers and his associates were now in disgrace
but there had been no report of the matter in the Press or on the telescreen
That was to be expected since it was unusual for political oenders to be put
on trial or even publicly denounced The great purges involving thousands of
people with public trials of traitors and thoughtcriminals who made abject
confession of their crimes and were afterwards executed were special show
pieces not occurring oftener than once in a couple of years More commonly
people who had incurred the displeasure of the Party simply disappeared and
were never heard of again One never had the smallest clue as to what had
happened to them In some cases they might not even be dead Perhaps thirty
people personally known to Winston not counting his parents had disappeared
at one time or another
Winston stroked his nose gently with a paperclip In the cubicle across
the way Comrade Tillotson was still crouching secretively over his speakwrite
He raised his head for a moment again the hostile spectacleash Winston
wondered whether Comrade Tillotson was engaged on the same job as himself
It was perfectly possible So tricky a piece of work would never be entrusted
to a single person on the other hand to turn it over to a committee would
be to admit openly that an act of fabrication was taking place Very likely as
many as a dozen people were now working away on rival versions of what Big
Brother had actually said And presently some master brain in the Inner Party
would select this version or that would reedit it and set in motion the complex
processes of crossreferencing that would be required and then the chosen lie
would pass into the permanent records and become truth
Winston did not know why Withers had been disgraced Perhaps it was for
corruption or incompetence Perhaps Big Brother was merely getting rid of a
toopopular subordinate Perhaps Withers or someone close to him had been
suspected of heretical tendencies Or perhaps  what was likeliest of all  the
thing had simply happened because purges and vaporizations were a necessary
part of the mechanics of government The only real clue lay in the words refs
unpersons which indicated that Withers was already dead You could not
invariably assume this to be the case when people were arrested Sometimes
they were released and allowed to remain at liberty for as much as a year or
two years before being executed Very occasionally some person whom you had
believed dead long since would make a ghostly reappearance at some public trial
where he would implicate hundreds of others by his testimony before vanishing
this time for ever Withers however was already an unperson He did not exist
he had never existed Winston decided that it would not be enough simply to
reverse the tendency of Big Brothers speech It was better to make it deal with
something totally unconnected with its original subject
He might turn the speech into the usual denunciation of traitors and thought
criminals but that was a little too obvious while to invent a victory at the front
or some triumph of overproduction in the Ninth ThreeYear Plan might com
plicate the records too much What was needed was a piece of pure fantasy
Suddenly there sprang into his mind ready made as it were the image of a cer
tain Comrade Ogilvy who had recently died in battle in heroic circumstances
There were occasions when Big Brother devoted his Order for the Day to com
memorating some humble rankandle Party member whose life and death he

===== Page 27 =====
held up as an example worthy to be followed Today he should commemorate
Comrade Ogilvy It was true that there was no such person as Comrade Ogilvy
but a few lines of print and a couple of faked photographs would soon bring him
into existence
Winston thought for a moment then pulled the speakwrite towards him
and began dictating in Big Brothers familiar style a style at once military
and pedantic and because of a trick of asking questions and then promptly
answering them What lessons do we learn from this fact comrades The
lesson  which is also one of the fundamental principles of Ingsoc  that etc
etc easy to imitate
At the age of three Comrade Ogilvy had refused all toys except a drum a
submachine gun and a model helicopter At six  a year early by a special
relaxation of the rules  he had joined the Spies at nine he had been a troop
leader At eleven he had denounced his uncle to the Thought Police after
overhearing a conversation which appeared to him to have criminal tendencies
At seventeen he had been a district organizer of the Junior AntiSex League
At nine teen he had designed a handgrenade which had been adopted by the
Ministry of Peace and which at its rst trial had killed thirtyone Eurasian
prisoners in one burst At twentythree he had perished in action Pursued by
enemy jet planes while ying over the Indian Ocean with important despatches
he had weighted his body with his machine gun and leapt out of the helicopter
into deep water despatches and all  an end said Big Brother which it was
impossible to contemplate without feelings of envy Big Brother added a few
remarks on the purity and singlemindedness of Comrade Ogilvys life He was
a total abstainer and a nonsmoker had no recreations except a daily hour in
the gymnasium and had taken a vow of celibacy believing marriage and the
care of a family to be incompatible with a twentyfourhouraday devotion to
duty He had no subjects of conversation except the principles of Ingsoc and
no aim in life except the defeat of the Eurasian enemy and the huntingdown of
spies saboteurs thoughtcriminals and traitors generally
Winston debated with himself whether to award Comrade Ogilvy the Order
of Conspicuous Merit in the end he decided against it because of the unneces
sary crossreferencing that it would entail
Once again he glanced at his rival in the opposite cubicle Something seemed
to tell him with certainty that Tillotson was busy on the same job as himself
There was no way of knowing whose job would nally be adopted but he felt a
profound conviction that it would be his own Comrade Ogilvy unimagined an
hour ago was now a fact It struck him as curious that you could create dead
men but not living ones Comrade Ogilvy who had never existed in the present
now existed in the past and when once the act of forgery was forgotten he
would exist just as authentically and upon the same evidence as Charlemagne
or Julius Caesar

Chapter 
In the lowceilinged canteen deep underground the lunch queue jerked slowly
forward The room was already very full and deafeningly noisy From the grille
at the counter the steam of stew came pouring forth with a sour metallic smell
which did not quite overcome the fumes of Victory Gin On the far side of the
room there was a small bar a mere hole in the wall where gin could be bought
at ten cents the large nip
Just the man I was looking for said a voice at Winstons back
He turned round It was his friend Syme who worked in the Research
Department Perhaps friend was not exactly the right word You did not have
friends nowadays you had comrades but there were some comrades whose
society was pleasanter than that of others Syme was a philologist a specialist
in Newspeak Indeed he was one of the enormous team of experts now engaged
in compiling the Eleventh Edition of the Newspeak Dictionary He was a tiny
creature smaller than Winston with dark hair and large protuberant eyes at
once mournful and derisive which seemed to search your face closely while he
was speaking to you
I wanted to ask you whether youd got any razor blades he said
Not one said Winston with a sort of guilty haste Ive tried all over the
place They dont exist any longer
Everyone kept asking you for razor blades Actually he had two unused ones
which he was hoarding up There had been a famine of them for months past
At any given moment there was some necessary article which the Party shops
were unable to supply Sometimes it was buttons sometimes it was darning
wool sometimes it was shoelaces at present it was razor blades You could
only get hold of them if at all by scrounging more or less furtively on the free
market
Ive been using the same blade for six weeks he added untruthfully
The queue gave another jerk forward As they halted he turned and faced
Syme again Each of them took a greasy metal tray from a pile at the end of
the counter
Did you go and see the prisoners hanged yesterday said Syme
I was working said Winston indierently I shall see it on the icks I
suppose
A very inadequate substitute said Syme
His mocking eyes roved over Winstons face I know you the eyes seemed
to say I see through you I know very well why you didnt go to see those
prisoners hanged In an intellectual way Syme was venomously orthodox He

===== Page 29 =====
would talk with a disagreeable gloating satisfaction of helicopter raids on enemy
villages and trials and confessions of thoughtcriminals the executions in the
cellars of the Ministry of Love Talking to him was largely a matter of getting
him away from such subjects and entangling him if possible in the technicalities
of Newspeak on which he was authoritative and interesting Winston turned
his head a little aside to avoid the scrutiny of the large dark eyes
It was a good hanging said Syme reminiscently I think it spoils it when
they tie their feet together I like to see them kicking And above all at the
end the tongue sticking right out and blue a quite bright blue Thats the
detail that appeals to me
Nex please yelled the whiteaproned prole with the ladle
Winston and Syme pushed their trays beneath the grille On to each was
dumped swiftly the regulation lunch  a metal pannikin of pinkishgrey stew
a hunk of bread a cube of cheese a mug of milkless Victory Coee and one
saccharine tablet
Theres a table over there under that telescreen said Syme Lets pick up
a gin on the way
The gin was served out to them in handleless china mugs They threaded
their way across the crowded room and unpacked their trays on to the metal
topped table on one corner of which someone had left a pool of stew a lthy
liquid mess that had the appearance of vomit Winston took up his mug of
gin paused for an instant to collect his nerve and gulped the oilytasting stu
down When he had winked the tears out of his eyes he suddenly discovered that
he was hungry He began swallowing spoonfuls of the stew which in among
its general sloppiness had cubes of spongy pinkish stu which was probably a
preparation of meat Neither of them spoke again till they had emptied their
pannikins From the table at Winstons left a little behind his back someone
was talking rapidly and continuously a harsh gabble almost like the quacking
of a duck which pierced the general uproar of the room
How is the Dictionary getting on said Winston raising his voice to over
come the noise
Slowly said Syme Im on the adjectives Its fascinating
He had brightened up immediately at the mention of Newspeak He pushed
his pannikin aside took up his hunk of bread in one delicate hand and his cheese
in the other and leaned across the table so as to be able to speak without
shouting
The Eleventh Edition is the denitive edition he said Were getting the
language into its nal shape  the shape its going to have when nobody speaks
anything else When weve nished with it people like you will have to learn it
all over again You think I dare say that our chief job is inventing new words
But not a bit of it Were destroying words  scores of them hundreds of them
every day Were cutting the language down to the bone The Eleventh Edition
wont contain a single word that will become obsolete before the year 
He bit hungrily into his bread and swallowed a couple of mouthfuls then
continued speaking with a sort of pedants passion His thin dark face had
become animated his eyes had lost their mocking expression and grown almost
dreamy
Its a beautiful thing the destruction of words Of course the great wastage
is in the verbs and adjectives but there are hundreds of nouns that can be got
rid of as well It isnt only the synonyms there are also the antonyms After all

===== Page 30 =====
what justication is there for a word which is simply the opposite of some other
word A word contains its opposite in itself Take good for instance If you
have a word like good what need is there for a word like bad Ungood
will do just as well  better because its an exact opposite which the other
is not Or again if you want a stronger version of good what sense is there
in having a whole string of vague useless words like excellent and splendid
and all the rest of them Plusgood covers the meaning or  doubleplusgood
if you want something stronger still Of course we use those forms already but
in the nal version of Newspeak therell be nothing else In the end the whole
notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six words  in reality
only one word Dont you see the beauty of that Winston It was BBs idea
originally of course he added as an afterthought
A sort of vapid eagerness itted across Winstons face at the mention of Big
Brother Nevertheless Syme immediately detected a certain lack of enthusiasm
You havent a real appreciation of Newspeak Winston he said almost
sadly Even when you write it youre still thinking in Oldspeak Ive read some
of those pieces that you write in The Times occasionally Theyre good enough
but theyre translations In your heart youd prefer to stick to Oldspeak with
all its vagueness and its useless shades of meaning You dont grasp the beauty
of the destruction of words Do you know that Newspeak is the only language
in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year
Winston did know that of course He smiled sympathetically he hoped not
trusting himself to speak Syme bit o another fragment of the darkcoloured
bread chewed it briey and went on
Dont you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of
thought In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible because
there will be no words in which to express it Every concept that can ever
be needed will be expressed by exactly one word with its meaning rigidly
dened and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten Already in
the Eleventh Edition were not far from that point But the process will still be
continuing long after you and I are dead Every year fewer and fewer words and
the range of consciousness always a little smaller Even now of course theres
no reason or excuse for committing thoughtcrime Its merely a question of
selfdiscipline realitycontrol But in the end there wont be any need even for
that The Revolution will be complete when the language is perfect Newspeak
is Ingsoc and Ingsoc is Newspeak he added with a sort of mystical satisfaction
Has it ever occurred to you Winston that by the year  at the very latest
not a single human being will be alive who could understand such a conversation
as we are having now
Except began Winston doubtfully and he stopped
It had been on the tip of his tongue to say Except the proles but he
checked himself not feeling fully certain that this remark was not in some way
unorthodox Syme however had divined what he was about to say
The proles are not human beings he said carelessly  By  earlier
probably  all real knowledge of Oldspeak will have disappeared The whole
literature of the past will have been destroyed Chaucer Shakespeare Milton
Byron  theyll exist only in Newspeak versions not merely changed into some
thing dierent but actually changed into something contradictory of what they
used to be Even the literature of the Party will change Even the slogans will
change How could you have a slogan like freedom is slavery when the concept

===== Page 31 =====
of freedom has been abolished The whole climate of thought will be dierent
In fact there will be no thought as we understand it now Orthodoxy means
not thinking  not needing to think Orthodoxy is unconsciousness
One of these days thought Winston with sudden deep conviction Syme will
be vaporized He is too intelligent He sees too clearly and speaks too plainly
The Party does not like such people One day he will disappear It is written
in his face
Winston had nished his bread and cheese He turned a little sideways in
his chair to drink his mug of coee At the table on his left the man with
the strident voice was still talking remorselessly away A young woman who
was perhaps his secretary and who was sitting with her back to Winston was
listening to him and seemed to be eagerly agreeing with everything that he said
From time to time Winston caught some such remark as I think youre so right
I do so agree with you uttered in a youthful and rather silly feminine voice But
the other voice never stopped for an instant even when the girl was speaking
Winston knew the man by sight though he knew no more about him than
that he held some important post in the Fiction Department He was a man
of about thirty with a muscular throat and a large mobile mouth His head
was thrown back a little and because of the angle at which he was sitting his
spectacles caught the light and presented to Winston two blank discs instead of
eyes What was slightly horrible was that from the stream of sound that poured
out of his mouth it was almost impossible to distinguish a single word Just
once Winston caught a phrasecomplete and nal elimination of Goldsteinism
jerked out very rapidly and as it seemed all in one piece like a line of type
cast solid For the rest it was just a noise a quackquackquacking And yet
though you could not actually hear what the man was saying you could not
be in any doubt about its general nature He might be denouncing Goldstein
and demanding sterner measures against thoughtcriminals and saboteurs he
might be fulminating against the atrocities of the Eurasian army he might be
praising Big Brother or the heroes on the Malabar frontit made no dierence
Whatever it was you could be certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy
pure Ingsoc As he watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving rapidly up
and down Winston had a curious feeling that this was not a real human being
but some kind of dummy It was not the mans brain that was speaking it was
his larynx The stu that was coming out of him consisted of words but it was
not speech in the true sense it was a noise uttered in unconsciousness like the
quacking of a duck
Syme had fallen silent for a moment and with the handle of his spoon was
tracing patterns in the puddle of stew The voice from the other table quacked
rapidly on easily audible in spite of the surrounding din
There is a word in Newspeak said Syme I dont know whether you know
it duckspeak to quack like a duck It is one of those interesting words that
have two contradictory meanings Applied to an opponent it is abuse applied
to someone you agree with it is praise
Unquestionably Syme will be vaporized Winston thought again He thought
it with a kind of sadness although well knowing that Syme despised him and
slightly disliked him and was fully capable of denouncing him as a thought
criminal if he saw any reason for doing so There was something subtly wrong
with Syme There was something that he lacked discretion aloofness a sort
of saving stupidity You could not say that he was unorthodox He believed in

===== Page 32 =====
the principles of Ingsoc he venerated Big Brother he rejoiced over victories
he hated heretics not merely with sincerity but with a sort of restless zeal
an uptodateness of information which the ordinary Party member did not
approach Yet a faint air of disreputability always clung to him He said things
that would have been better unsaid he had read too many books he frequented
the Chestnut Tree Caf e haunt of painters and musicians There was no law
not even an unwritten law against frequenting the Chestnut Tree Caf e yet the
place was somehow illomened The old discredited leaders of the Party had
been used to gather there before they were nally purged Goldstein himself it
was said had sometimes been seen there years and decades ago Symes fate
was not dicult to foresee And yet it was a fact that if Syme grasped even for
three seconds the nature of his Winstons secret opinions he would betray him
instantly to the Thought police So would anybody else for that matter but
Syme more than most Zeal was not enough Orthodoxy was unconsciousness
Syme looked up Here comes Parsons he said
Something in the tone of his voice seemed to add that bloody fool Parsons
Winstons fellowtenant at Victory Mansions was in fact threading his way
across the room  a tubby middlesized man with fair hair and a froglike face
At thirtyve he was already putting on rolls of fat at neck and waistline but his
movements were brisk and boyish His whole appearance was that of a little boy
grown large so much so that although he was wearing the regulation overalls it
was almost impossible not to think of him as being dressed in the blue shorts
grey shirt and red neckerchief of the Spies In visualizing him one saw always a
picture of dimpled knees and sleeves rolled back from pudgy forearms Parsons
did indeed invariably revert to shorts when a community hike or any other
physical activity gave him an excuse for doing so He greeted them both with a
cheery Hullo hullo and sat down at the table giving o an intense smell of
sweat Beads of moisture stood out all over his pink face His powers of sweating
were extraordinary At the Community Centre you could always tell when he
had been playing tabletennis by the dampness of the bat handle Syme had
produced a strip of paper on which there was a long column of words and was
studying it with an inkpencil between his ngers
Look at him working away in the lunch hour said Parsons nudging Win
ston Keenness eh Whats that youve got there old boy Something a bit
too brainy for me I expect Smith old boy Ill tell you why Im chasing you
Its that sub you forgot to give me
Which sub is that said Winston automatically feeling for money About a
quarter of ones salary had to be earmarked for voluntary subscriptions which
were so numerous that it was dicult to keep track of them
For Hate Week You know  the housebyhouse fund Im treasurer for
our block Were making an allout eort  going to put on a tremendous show
I tell you it wont be my fault if old Victory Mansions doesnt have the biggest
outt of ags in the whole street Two dollars you promised me
Winston found and handed over two creased and lthy notes which Parsons
entered in a small notebook in the neat handwriting of the illiterate
By the way old boy he said I hear that little beggar of mine let y at
you with his catapult yesterday I gave him a good dressingdown for it In fact
I told him Id take the catapult away if he does it again
I think he was a little upset at not going to the execution said Winston
 Ah well  what I mean to say shows the right spirit doesnt it Mis

===== Page 33 =====
chievous little beggars they are both of them but talk about keenness All they
think about is the Spies and the war of course Dyou know what that little
girl of mine did last Saturday when her troop was on a hike out Berkhamsted
way She got two other girls to go with her slipped o from the hike and
spent the whole afternoon following a strange man They kept on his tail for
two hours right through the woods and then when they got into Amersham
handed him over to the patrols
What did they do that for said Winston somewhat taken aback Parsons
went on triumphantly
My kid made sure he was some kind of enemy agent  might have been
dropped by parachute for instance But heres the point old boy What do you
think put her on to him in the rst place She spotted he was wearing a funny
kind of shoes  said shed never seen anyone wearing shoes like that before So
the chances were he was a foreigner Pretty smart for a nipper of seven eh
What happened to the man said Winston
Ah that I couldnt say of course But I wouldnt be altogether surprised
if Parsons made the motion of aiming a rie and clicked his tongue for the
explosion
Good said Syme abstractedly without looking up from his strip of paper
Of course we cant aord to take chances agreed Winston dutifully
What I mean to say there is a war on said Parsons
As though in conrmation of this a trumpet call oated from the telescreen
just above their heads However it was not the proclamation of a military
victory this time but merely an announcement from the Ministry of Plenty
Comrades cried an eager youthful voice Attention comrades We have
glorious news for you We have won the battle for production Returns now
completed of the output of all classes of consumption goods show that the
standard of living has risen by no less than  per cent over the past year All
over Oceania this morning there were irrepressible spontaneous demonstrations
when workers marched out of factories and oces and paraded through the
streets with banners voicing their gratitude to Big Brother for the new happy
life which his wise leadership has bestowed upon us Here are some of the
completed gures Foodstus
The phrase our new happy life recurred several times It had been a
favourite of late with the Ministry of Plenty Parsons his attention caught by
the trumpet call sat listening with a sort of gaping solemnity a sort of edied
boredom He could not follow the gures but he was aware that they were in
some way a cause for satisfaction He had lugged out a huge and lthy pipe
which was already half full of charred tobacco With the tobacco ration at
 grammes a week it was seldom possible to ll a pipe to the top Winston
was smoking a Victory Cigarette which he held carefully horizontal The new
ration did not start till tomorrow and he had only four cigarettes left For the
moment he had shut his ears to the remoter noises and was listening to the
stu that streamed out of the telescreen It appeared that there had even been
demonstrations to thank Big Brother for raising the chocolate ration to twenty
grammes a week And only yesterday he reected it had been announced that
the ration was to be reduced to twenty grammes a week Was it possible that
they could swallow that after only twentyfour hours Yes they swallowed it
Parsons swallowed it easily with the stupidity of an animal The eyeless creature
at the other table swallowed it fanatically passionately with a furious desire

===== Page 34 =====
to track down denounce and vaporize anyone who should suggest that last
week the ration had been thirty grammes Syme tooin some more complex
way involving doublethink Syme swallowed it Was he then alone in the
possession of a memory
The fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the telescreen As compared
with last year there was more food more clothes more houses more furniture
more cookingpots more fuel more ships more helicopters more books more
babies  more of everything except disease crime and insanity Year by year
and minute by minute everybody and everything was whizzing rapidly upwards
As Syme had done earlier Winston had taken up his spoon and was dabbling
in the palecoloured gravy that dribbled across the table drawing a long streak
of it out into a pattern He meditated resentfully on the physical texture of
life Had it always been like this Had food always tasted like this He looked
round the canteen A lowceilinged crowded room its walls grimy from the
contact of innumerable bodies battered metal tables and chairs placed so close
together that you sat with elbows touching bent spoons dented trays coarse
white mugs all surfaces greasy grime in every crack and a sourish composite
smell of bad gin and bad coee and metallic stew and dirty clothes Always in
your stomach and in your skin there was a sort of protest a feeling that you
had been cheated of something that you had a right to It was true that he had
no memories of anything greatly dierent In any time that he could accurately
remember there had never been quite enough to eat one had never had socks
or underclothes that were not full of holes furniture had always been battered
and rickety rooms underheated tube trains crowded houses falling to pieces
bread darkcoloured tea a rarity coee lthytasting cigarettes insucient 
nothing cheap and plentiful except synthetic gin And though of course it grew
worse as ones body aged was it not a sign that this was not the natural order
of things if ones heart sickened at the discomfort and dirt and scarcity the
interminable winters the stickiness of ones socks the lifts that never worked
the cold water the gritty soap the cigarettes that came to pieces the food with
its strange evil tastes Why should one feel it to be intolerable unless one had
some kind of ancestral memory that things had once been dierent
He looked round the canteen again Nearly everyone was ugly and would
still have been ugly even if dressed otherwise than in the uniform blue overalls
On the far side of the room sitting at a table alone a small curiously beetlelike
man was drinking a cup of coee his little eyes darting suspicious glances from
side to side How easy it was thought Winston if you did not look about you
to believe that the physical type set up by the Party as an idealtall muscular
youths and deepbosomed maidens blondhaired vital sunburnt carefree 
existed and even predominated Actually so far as he could judge the majority
of people in Airstrip One were small dark and illfavoured It was curious how
that beetlelike type proliferated in the Ministries little dumpy men growing
stout very early in life with short legs swift scuttling movements and fat
inscrutable faces with very small eyes It was the type that seemed to ourish
best under the dominion of the Party
The announcement from the Ministry of Plenty ended on another trumpet
call and gave way to tinny music Parsons stirred to vague enthusiasm by the
bombardment of gures took his pipe out of his mouth
The Ministry of Plentys certainly done a good job this year he said with
a knowing shake of his head By the way Smith old boy I suppose you havent

got any razor blades you can let me have
Not one said Winston Ive been using the same blade for six weeks
myself
Ah well  just thought Id ask you old boy
Sorry said Winston
The quacking voice from the next table temporarily silenced during the
Ministrys announcement had started up again as loud as ever For some reason
Winston suddenly found himself thinking of Mrs Parsons with her wispy hair
and the dust in the creases of her face Within two years those children would be
denouncing her to the Thought Police Mrs Parsons would be vaporized Syme
would be vaporized Winston would be vaporized OBrien would be vaporized
Parsons on the other hand would never be vaporized The eyeless creature
with the quacking voice would never be vaporized The little beetlelike men
who scuttle so nimbly through the labyrinthine corridors of Ministries they too
would never be vaporized And the girl with dark hair the girl from the Fiction
Department  she would never be vaporized either It seemed to him that he
knew instinctively who would survive and who would perish though just what
it was that made for survival it was not easy to say
At this moment he was dragged out of his reverie with a violent jerk The
girl at the next table had turned partly round and was looking at him It was
the girl with dark hair She was looking at him in a sidelong way but with
curious intensity The instant she caught his eye she looked away again
The sweat started out on Winstons backbone A horrible pang of terror
went through him It was gone almost at once but it left a sort of nagging
uneasiness behind Why was she watching him Why did she keep following
him about Unfortunately he could not remember whether she had already been
at the table when he arrived or had come there afterwards But yesterday at
any rate during the Two Minutes Hate she had sat immediately behind him
when there was no apparent need to do so Quite likely her real object had been
to listen to him and make sure whether he was shouting loudly enough
His earlier thought returned to him probably she was not actually a member
of the Thought Police but then it was precisely the amateur spy who was the
greatest danger of all He did not know how long she had been looking at him
but perhaps for as much as ve minutes and it was possible that his features had
not been perfectly under control It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts
wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen
The smallest thing could give you away A nervous tic an unconscious look of
anxiety a habit of muttering to yourself  anything that carried with it the
suggestion of abnormality of having something to hide In any case to wear
an improper expression on your face to look incredulous when a victory was
announced for example was itself a punishable oence There was even a word
for it in Newspeak facecrime it was called
The girl had turned her back on him again Perhaps after all she was not
really following him about perhaps it was coincidence that she had sat so close
to him two days running His cigarette had gone out and he laid it carefully on
the edge of the table He would nish smoking it after work if he could keep the
tobacco in it Quite likely the person at the next table was a spy of the Thought
Police and quite likely he would be in the cellars of the Ministry of Love within
three days but a cigarette end must not be wasted Syme had folded up his
strip of paper and stowed it away in his pocket Parsons had begun talking

Did I ever tell you old boy he said chuckling round the stem of his pipe
about the time when those two nippers of mine set re to the old market
womans skirt because they saw her wrapping up sausages in a poster of BB
Sneaked up behind her and set re to it with a box of matches Burned her
quite badly I believe Little beggars eh But keen as mustard Thats a rst

even What dyou thinks the latest thing theyve served them out with Ear
trumpets for listening through keyholes My little girl brought one home the
other night  tried it out on our sittingroom door and reckoned she could
hear twice as much as with her ear to the hole Of course its only a toy mind
you Still gives em the right idea eh
At this moment the telescreen let out a piercing whistle It was the signal to
return to work All three men sprang to their feet to join in the struggle round
the lifts and the remaining tobacco fell out of Winstons cigarette

Chapter 
Winston was writing in his diary
It was three years ago It was on a dark evening in a narrow sidestreet near
one of the big railway stations She was standing near a doorway in the wall
under a street lamp that hardly gave any light She had a young face painted
very thick It was really the paint that appealed to me the whiteness of it like
a mask and the bright red lips Party women never paint their faces There
was nobody else in the street and no telescreens She said two dollars I
For the moment it was too dicult to go on He shut his eyes and pressed
his ngers against them trying to squeeze out the vision that kept recurring
He had an almost overwhelming temptation to shout a string of lthy words
at the top of his voice Or to bang his head against the wall to kick over the
table and hurl the inkpot through the window  to do any violent or noisy or
painful thing that might black out the memory that was tormenting him
Your worst enemy he reected was your own nervous system At any mo
ment the tension inside you was liable to translate itself into some visible symp
tom He thought of a man whom he had passed in the street a few weeks back
a quite ordinarylooking man a Party member aged thirtyve to forty tallish
and thin carrying a briefcase They were a few metres apart when the left side
of the mans face was suddenly contorted by a sort of spasm It happened again
just as they were passing one another it was only a twitch a quiver rapid
as the clicking of a camera shutter but obviously habitual He remembered
thinking at the time That poor devil is done for And what was frightening
was that the action was quite possibly unconscious The most deadly danger of
all was talking in your sleep There was no way of guarding against that so far
as he could see
He drew his breath and went on writing
I went with her through the doorway and across a backyard into a basement
kitchen There was a bed against the wall and a lamp on the table turned
down very low She
His teeth were set on edge He would have liked to spit Simultaneously
with the woman in the basement kitchen he thought of Katharine his wife
Winston was married  had been married at any rate probably he still was
married so far as he knew his wife was not dead He seemed to breathe again
the warm stuy odour of the basement kitchen an odour compounded of bugs
and dirty clothes and villainous cheap scent but nevertheless alluring because
no woman of the Party ever used scent or could be imagined as doing so Only
the proles used scent In his mind the smell of it was inextricably mixed up

with fornication
When he had gone with that woman it had been his rst lapse in two years
or thereabouts Consorting with prostitutes was forbidden of course but it
was one of those rules that you could occasionally nerve yourself to break It
was dangerous but it was not a lifeanddeath matter To be caught with a
prostitute might mean ve years in a forcedlabour camp not more if you had
committed no other oence And it was easy enough provided that you could
avoid being caught in the act The poorer quarters swarmed with women who
were ready to sell themselves Some could even be purchased for a bottle of
gin which the proles were not supposed to drink Tacitly the Party was even
inclined to encourage prostitution as an outlet for instincts which could not
be altogether suppressed Mere debauchery did not matter very much so long
as it was furtive and joyless and only involved the women of a submerged and
despised class The unforgivable crime was promiscuity between Party members
But  though this was one of the crimes that the accused in the great purges
invariably confessed to  it was dicult to imagine any such thing actually
happening
The aim of the Party was not merely to prevent men and women from
forming loyalties which it might not be able to control Its real undeclared
purpose was to remove all pleasure from the sexual act Not love so much as
eroticism was the enemy inside marriage as well as outside it All marriages
between Party members had to be approved by a committee appointed for the
purpose and  though the principle was never clearly stated  permission was
always refused if the couple concerned gave the impression of being physically
attracted to one another The only recognized purpose of marriage was to beget
children for the service of the Party Sexual intercourse was to be looked on as
a slightly disgusting minor operation like having an enema This again was
never put into plain words but in an indirect way it was rubbed into every
Party member from childhood onwards There were even organizations such as
the Junior AntiSex League which advocated complete celibacy for both sexes
All children were to be begotten by articial insemination artsem it was called
in Newspeak and brought up in public institutions This Winston was aware
was not meant altogether seriously but somehow it tted in with the general
ideology of the Party The Party was trying to kill the sex instinct or if it
could not be killed then to distort it and dirty it He did not know why this
was so but it seemed natural that it should be so And as far as the women
were concerned the Partys eorts were largely successful
He thought again of Katharine It must be nine ten  nearly eleven years
since they had parted It was curious how seldom he thought of her For days
at a time he was capable of forgetting that he had ever been married They had
only been together for about fteen months The Party did not permit divorce
but it rather encouraged separation in cases where there were no children
Katharine was a tall fairhaired girl very straight with splendid movements
She had a bold aquiline face a face that one might have called noble until one
discovered that there was as nearly as possible nothing behind it Very early in
her married life he had decided  though perhaps it was only that he knew her
more intimately than he knew most people  that she had without exception
the most stupid vulgar empty mind that he had ever encountered She had
not a thought in her head that was not a slogan and there was no imbecility
absolutely none that she was not capable of swallowing if the Party handed it

out to her The human soundtrack he nicknamed her in his own mind Yet
he could have endured living with her if it had not been for just one thing 
sex
As soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stien To embrace
her was like embracing a jointed wooden image And what was strange was
that even when she was clasping him against her he had the feeling that she
was simultaneously pushing him away with all her strength The rigidlty of
her muscles managed to convey that impression She would lie there with shut
eyes neither resisting nor cooperating but submitting It was extraordinarily
embarrassing and after a while horrible But even then he could have borne
living with her if it had been agreed that they should remain celibate But
curiously enough it was Katharine who refused this They must she said
produce a child if they could So the performance continued to happen once a
week quite regulariy whenever it was not impossible She even used to remind
him of it in the morning as something which had to be done that evening and
which must not be forgotten She had two names for it One was making a
baby and the other was our duty to the Party yes she had actually used
that phrase Quite soon he grew to have a feeling of positive dread when the
appointed day came round But luckily no child appeared and in the end she
agreed to give up trying and soon afterwards they parted
Winston sighed inaudibly He picked up his pen again and wrote
She threw herself down on the bed and at once without any kind of pre
liminary in the most coarse horrible way you can imagine pulled up her skirt
I
He saw himself standing there in the dim lamplight with the smell of bugs
and cheap scent in his nostrils and in his heart a feeling of defeat and resentment
which even at that moment was mixed up with the thought of Katharines white
body frozen for ever by the hypnotic power of the Party Why did it always
have to be like this Why could he not have a woman of his own instead of
these lthy scues at intervals of years But a real love aair was an almost
unthinkable event The women of the Party were all alike Chastity was as deep
ingrained in them as Party loyalty By careful early conditioning by games and
cold water by the rubbish that was dinned into them at school and in the Spies
and the Youth League by lectures parades songs slogans and martial music
the natural feeling had been driven out of them His reason told him that there
must be exceptions but his heart did not believe it They were all impregnable
as the Party intended that they should be And what he wanted more even
than to be loved was to break down that wall of virtue even if it were only once
in his whole life The sexual act successfully performed was rebellion Desire
was thoughtcrime Even to have awakened Katharine if he could have achieved
it would have been like a seduction although she was his wife
But the rest of the story had got to be written down He wrote
I turned up the lamp When I saw her in the light
After the darkness the feeble light of the paran lamp had seemed very
bright For the rst time he could see the woman properly He had taken a step
towards her and then halted full of lust and terror He was painfully conscious
of the risk he had taken in coming here It was perfectly possible that the
patrols would catch him on the way out for that matter they might be waiting
outside the door at this moment If he went away without even doing what he
had come here to do

===== Page 40 =====
It had got to be written down it had got to be confessed What he had
suddenly seen in the lamplight was that the woman was old The paint was
plastered so thick on her face that it looked as though it might crack like a
cardboard mask There were streaks of white in her hair but the truly dreadful
detail was that her mouth had fallen a little open revealing nothing except a
cavernous blackness She had no teeth at all
He wrote hurriedly in scrabbling handwriting
When I saw her in the light she was quite an old woman fty years old at
least But I went ahead and did it just the same
He pressed his ngers against his eyelids again He had written it down at
last but it made no dierence The therapy had not worked The urge to shout
lthy words at the top of his voice was as strong as ever

Chapter 
If there is hope wrote Winston it lies in the proles
If there was hope it must lie in the proles because only there in those
swarming disregarded masses  per cent of the population of Oceania could
the force to destroy the Party ever be generated The Party could not be over
thrown from within Its enemies if it had any enemies had no way of coming
together or even of identifying one another Even if the legendary Brotherhood
existed as just possibly it might it was inconceivable that its members could
ever assemble in larger numbers than twos and threes Rebellion meant a look
in the eyes an inexion of the voice at the most an occasional whispered
word But the proles if only they could somehow become conscious of their
own strength would have no need to conspire They needed only to rise up and
shake themselves like a horse shaking o ies If they chose they could blow
the Party to pieces tomorrow morning Surely sooner or later it must occur to
them to do it And yet
He remembered how once he had been walking down a crowded street when
a tremendous shout of hundreds of voices womens voices  had burst from a
sidestreet a little way ahead It was a great formidable cry of anger and despair
a deep loud Ohooooh that went humming on like the reverberation of a
bell His heart had leapt Its started he had thought A riot The proles are
breaking loose at last When he had reached the spot it was to see a mob of
two or three hundred women crowding round the stalls of a street market with
faces as tragic as though they had been the doomed passengers on a sinking
ship But at this moment the general despair broke down into a multitude
of individual quarrels It appeared that one of the stalls had been selling tin
saucepans They were wretched imsy things but cookingpots of any kind
were always dicult to get Now the supply had unexpectedly given out The
successful women bumped and jostled by the rest were trying to make o with
their saucepans while dozens of others clamoured round the stall accusing the
stallkeeper of favouritism and of having more saucepans somewhere in reserve
There was a fresh outburst of yells Two bloated women one of them with her
hair coming down had got hold of the same saucepan and were trying to tear
it out of one anothers hands For a moment they were both tugging and then
the handle came o Winston watched them disgustedly And yet just for a
moment what almost frightening power had sounded in that cry from only a
few hundred throats Why was it that they could never shout like that about
anything that mattered
He wrote

Until they become conscious they will never rebel and until after they have
rebelled they cannot become conscious
That he reected might almost have been a transcription from one of the
Party textbooks The Party claimed of course to have liberated the proles
from bondage Before the Revolution they had been hideously oppressed by the
capitalists they had been starved and ogged women had been forced to work
in the coal mines women still did work in the coal mines as a matter of fact
children had been sold into the factories at the age of six But simultaneously
true to the Principles of doublethink the Party taught that the proles were
natural inferiors who must be kept in subjection like animals by the application
of a few simple rules In reality very little was known about the proles It was
not necessary to know much So long as they continued to work and breed
their other activities were without importance Left to themselves like cattle
turned loose upon the plains of Argentina they had reverted to a style of life
that appeared to be natural to them a sort of ancestral pattern They were
born they grew up in the gutters they went to work at twelve they passed
through a brief blossomingperiod of beauty and sexual desire they married
at twenty they were middleaged at thirty they died for the most part at
sixty Heavy physical work the care of home and children petty quarrels with
neighbours lms football beer and above all gambling lled up the horizon
of their minds To keep them in control was not dicult A few agents of
the Thought Police moved always among them spreading false rumours and
marking down and eliminating the few individuals who were judged capable of
becoming dangerous but no attempt was made to indoctrinate them with the
ideology of the Party It was not desirable that the proles should have strong
political feelings All that was required of them was a primitive patriotism which
could be appealed to whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer
workinghours or shorter rations And even when they became discontented
as they sometimes did their discontent led nowhere because being without
general ideas they could only focus it on petty specic grievances The larger
evils invariably escaped their notice The great majority of proles did not even
have telescreens in their homes Even the civil police interfered with them
very little There was a vast amount of criminality in London a whole world
withinaworld of thieves bandits prostitutes drugpeddlers and racketeers of
every description but since it all happened among the proles themselves it
was of no importance In all questions of morals they were allowed to follow
their ancestral code The sexual puritanism of the Party was not imposed upon
them Promiscuity went unpunished divorce was permitted For that matter
even religious worship would have been permitted if the proles had shown any
sign of needing or wanting it They were beneath suspicion As the Party slogan
put it Proles and animals are free
Winston reached down and cautiously scratched his varicose ulcer It had
begun itching again The thing you invariably came back to was the impossi
bility of knowing what life before the Revolution had really been like He took
out of the drawer a copy of a childrens history textbook which he had borrowed
from Mrs Parsons and began copying a passage into the diary
In the old days it ran before the glorious Revolution London was not the
beautiful city that we know today It was a dark dirty miserable place where
hardly anybody had enough to eat and where hundreds and thousands of poor
people had no boots on their feet and not even a roof to sleep under Children

===== Page 43 =====
no older than you had to work twelve hours a day for cruel masters who ogged
them with whips if they worked too slowly and fed them on nothing but stale
breadcrusts and water
But in among all this terrible poverty there were just a few great big beautiful
houses that were lived in by rich men who had as many as thirty servants to
look after them These rich men were called capitalists They were fat ugly
men with wicked faces like the one in the picture on the opposite page You
can see that he is dressed in a long black coat which was called a frock coat
and a queer shiny hat shaped like a stovepipe which was called a top hat This
was the uniform of the capitalists and no one else was allowed to wear it The
capitalists owned everything in the world and everyone else was their slave
They owned all the land all the houses all the factories and all the money If
anyone disobeyed them they could throw them into prison or they could take
his job away and starve him to death When any ordinary person spoke to a
capitalist he had to cringe and bow to him and take o his cap and address
him as Sir The chief of all the capitalists was called the King and
But he knew the rest of the catalogue There would be mention of the bishops
in their lawn sleeves the judges in their ermine robes the pillory the stocks
the treadmill the catonine tails the Lord Mayors Banquet and the practice
of kissing the Popes toe There was also something called the jus primae noctis
which would probably not be mentioned in a textbook for children It was the
law by which every capitalist had the right to sleep with any woman working in
one of his factories
How could you tell how much of it was lies It might be true that the average
human being was better o now than he had been before the Revolution The
only evidence to the contrary was the mute protest in your own bones the
instinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in were intolerable and that at
some other time they must have been dierent It struck him that the truly
characteristic thing about modern life was not its cruelty and insecurity but
simply its bareness its dinginess its listlessness Life if you looked about you
bore no resemblance not only to the lies that streamed out of the telescreens
but even to the ideals that the Party was trying to achieve Great areas of it
even for a Party member were neutral and nonpolitical a matter of slogging
through dreary jobs ghting for a place on the Tube darning a wornout sock
cadging a saccharine tablet saving a cigarette end The ideal set up by the Party
was something huge terrible and glittering  a world of steel and concrete of
monstrous machines and terrifying weapons  a nation of warriors and fanatics
marching forward in perfect unity all thinking the same thoughts and shouting
the same slogans perpetually working ghting triumphing persecuting 
three hundred million people all with the same face The reality was decaying
dingy cities where underfed people shued to and fro in leaky shoes in patched
up nineteenthcentury houses that smelt always of cabbage and bad lavatories
He seemed to see a vision of London vast and ruinous city of a million dustbins
and mixed up with it was a picture of Mrs Parsons a woman with lined face
and wispy hair ddling helplessly with a blocked wastepipe
He reached down and scratched his ankle again Day and night the tele
screens bruised your ears with statistics proving that people today had more
food more clothes better houses better recreations  that they lived longer
worked shorter hours were bigger healthier stronger happier more intelligent
better educated than the people of fty years ago Not a word of it could ever

be proved or disproved The Party claimed for example that today  per cent
of adult proles were literate before the Revolution it was said the number had
only been  per cent The Party claimed that the infant mortality rate was
now only  per thousand whereas before the Revolution it had been  
and so it went on It was like a single equation with two unknowns It might
very well be that literally every word in the history books even the things that
one accepted without question was pure fantasy For all he knew there might
never have been any such law as the jus primae noctis or any such creature as
a capitalist or any such garment as a top hat
Everything faded into mist The past was erased the erasure was forgotten
the lie became truth Just once in his life he had possessed  after the event
that was what counted  concrete unmistakable evidence of an act of falsica
tion He had held it between his ngers for as long as thirty seconds In 
it must have been  at any rate
it was at about the time when he and Katharine had parted But the really
relevant date was seven or eight years earlier
The story really began in the middle sixties the period of the great purges
in which the original leaders of the Revolution were wiped out once and for all
By  none of them was left except Big Brother himself All the rest had by
that time been exposed as traitors and counter revolutionaries Goldstein had
ed and was hiding no one knew where and of the others a few had simply
disappeared while the majority had been executed after spectacular public trials
at which they made confession of their crimes Among the last survivors were
three men named Jones Aaronson and Rutherford It must have been in 
that these three had been arrested As often happened they had vanished for
a year or more so that one did not know whether they were alive or dead and
then had suddenly been brought forth to incriminate themselves in the usual
way They had confessed to intelligence with the enemy at that date too
the enemy was Eurasia embezzlement of public funds the murder of various
trusted Party members intrigues against the leadership of Big Brother which
had started long before the Revolution happened and acts of sabotage causing
the death of hundreds of thousands of people After confessing to these things
they had been pardoned reinstated in the Party and given posts which were in
fact sinecures but which sounded important All three had written long abject
articles in The Times analysing the reasons for their defection and promising
to make amends
Some time after their release Winston had actually seen all three of them
in the Chestnut Tree Caf e He remembered the sort of terried fascination
with which he had watched them out of the corner of his eye They were men
far older than himself relics of the ancient world almost the last great gures
left over from the heroic days of the Party The glamour of the underground
struggle and the civil war still faintly clung to them He had the feeling though
already at that time facts and dates were growing blurry that he had known
their names years earlier than he had known that of Big Brother But also
they were outlaws enemies untouchables doomed with absolute certainty to
extinction within a year or two No one who had once fallen into the hands of
the Thought Police ever escaped in the end They were corpses waiting to be
sent back to the grave
There was no one at any of the tables nearest to them It was not wise even
to be seen in the neighbourhood of such people They were sitting in silence

===== Page 45 =====
before glasses of the gin avoured with cloves which was the speciality of the
caf e Of the three it was Rutherford whose appearance had most impressed
Winston Rutherford had once been a famous caricaturist whose brutal car
toons had helped to iname popular opinion before and during the Revolution
Even now at long intervals his cartoons were appearing in The Times They
were simply an imitation of his earlier manner and curiously lifeless and uncon
vincing Always they were a rehashing of the ancient themes  slum tenements
starving children street battles capitalists in top hats  even on the barricades
the capitalists still seemed to cling to their top hats an endless hopeless eort
to get back into the past He was a monstrous man with a mane of greasy grey
hair his face pouched and seamed with thick negroid lips At one time he must
have been immensely strong now his great body was sagging sloping bulging
falling away in every direction He seemed to be breaking up before ones eyes
like a mountain crumbling
It was the lonely hour of fteen Winston could not now remember how
he had come to be in the caf e at such a time The place was almost empty
A tinny music was trickling from the telescreens The three men sat in their
corner almost motionless never speaking Uncommanded the waiter brought
fresh glasses of gin There was a chessboard on the table beside them with
the pieces set out but no game started And then for perhaps half a minute
in all something happened to the telescreens The tune that they were playing
changed and the tone of the music changed too There came into it  but
it was something hard to describe It was a peculiar cracked braying jeering
note in his mind Winston called it a yellow note And then a voice from the
telescreen was singing
Under the spreading chestnut tree
I sold you and you sold me
There lie they and here lie we
Under the spreading chestnut tree
The three men never stirred But when Winston glanced again at Ruther
fords ruinous face he saw that his eyes were full of tears And for the rst
time he noticed with a kind of inward shudder and yet not knowing at what
he shuddered that both Aaronson and Rutherford had broken noses
A little later all three were rearrested It appeared that they had engaged
in fresh conspiracies from the very moment of their release At their second
trial they confessed to all their old crimes over again with a whole string of new
ones They were executed and their fate was recorded in the Party histories a
warning to posterity About ve years after this in  Winston was unrolling
a wad of documents which had just opped out of the pneumatic tube on to his
desk when he came on a fragment of paper which had evidently been slipped
in among the others and then forgotten The instant he had attened it out
he saw its signicance It was a halfpage torn out of The Times of about ten
years earlier  the top half of the page so that it included the date  and it
contained a photograph of the delegates at some Party function in New York
Prominent in the middle of the group were Jones Aaronson and Rutherford
There was no mistaking them in any case their names were in the caption at
the bottom
The point was that at both trials all three men had confessed that on that
date they had been on Eurasian soil They had own from a secret aireld in
Canada to a rendezvous somewhere in Siberia and had conferred with members

===== Page 46 =====
of the Eurasian General Sta to whom they had betrayed important military
secrets The date had stuck in Winstons memory because it chanced to be
midsummer day but the whole story must be on record in countless other
places as well There was only one possible conclusion the confessions were
lies
Of course this was not in itself a discovery Even at that time Winston had
not imagined that the people who were wiped out in the purges had actually
committed the crimes that they were accused of But this was concrete evidence
it was a fragment of the abolished past like a fossil bone which turns up in the
wrong stratum and destroys a geological theory It was enough to blow the
Party to atoms if in some way it could have been published to the world and
its signicance made known
He had gone straight on working As soon as he saw what the photograph
was and what it meant he had covered it up with another sheet of paper
Luckily when he unrolled it it had been upsidedown from the point of view of
the telescreen
He took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back his chair so as to get
as far away from the telescreen as possible To keep your face expressionless was
not dicult and even your breathing could be controlled with an eort but you
could not control the beating of your heart and the telescreen was quite delicate
enough to pick it up He let what he judged to be ten minutes go by tormented
all the while by the fear that some accident  a sudden draught blowing across
his desk for instance  would betray him Then without uncovering it again
he dropped the photograph into the memory hole along with some other waste
papers Within another minute perhaps it would have crumbled into ashes
That was ten  eleven years ago Today probably he would have kept that
photograph It was curious that the fact of having held it in his ngers seemed
to him to make a dierence even now when the photograph itself as well as
the event it recorded was only memory Was the Partys hold upon the past
less strong he wondered because a piece of evidence which existed no longer
had once existed
But today supposing that it could be somehow resurrected from its ashes
the photograph might not even be evidence Already at the time when he made
his discovery Oceania was no longer at war with Eurasia and it must have been
to the agents of Eastasia that the three dead men had betrayed their country
Since then there had been other changes  two three he could not remember
how many Very likely the confessions had been rewritten and rewritten until
the original facts and dates no longer had the smallest signicance The past not
only changed but changed continuously What most aicted him with the sense
of nightmare was that he had never clearly understood why the huge imposture
was undertaken The immediate advantages of falsifying the past were obvious
but the ultimate motive was mysterious He took up his pen again and wrote
I understand HOW I do not understand WHY
He wondered as he had many times wondered before whether he himself
was a lunatic Perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one At one time it
had been a sign of madness to believe that the earth goes round the sun today
to believe that the past is inalterable He might be alone in holding that belief
and if alone then a lunatic But the thought of being a lunatic did not greatly
trouble him the horror was that he might also be wrong
He picked up the childrens history book and looked at the portrait of Big

that penetrated inside your skull battering against your brain frightening you
out of your beliefs persuading you almost to deny the evidence of your senses
In the end the Party would announce that two and two made ve and you
would have to believe it It was inevitable that they should make that claim
sooner or later the logic of their position demanded it Not merely the validity
of experience but the very existence of external reality was tacitly denied by
their philosophy The heresy of heresies was common sense And what was
terrifying was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise but that they
might be right For after all how do we know that two and two make four
Or that the force of gravity works Or that the past is unchangeable If both
the past and the external world exist only in the mind and if the mind itself is
controllable what then
But no His courage seemed suddenly to stien of its own accord The face
of OBrien not called up by any obvious association had oated into his mind
He knew with more certainty than before that OBrien was on his side He was
writing the diary for OBrien  to OBrien it was like an interminable letter
which no one would ever read but which was addressed to a particular person
and took its colour from that fact
The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears It was their
nal most essential command His heart sank as he thought of the enormous
power arrayed against him the ease with which any Party intellectual would
overthrow him in debate the subtle arguments which he would not be able
to understand much less answer And yet he was in the right They were
wrong and he was right The obvious the silly and the true had got to be
defended Truisms are true hold on to that The solid world exists its laws do
not change Stones are hard water is wet objects unsupported fall towards the
earths centre With the feeling that he was speaking to OBrien and also that
he was setting forth an important axiom he wrote
Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four If that is granted
all else follows

Chapter 
From somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell of roasting coee  real
coee not Victory Coee  came oating out into the street Winston paused
involuntarily For perhaps two seconds he was back in the halfforgotten world
of his childhood Then a door banged seeming to cut o the smell as abruptly
as though it had been a sound
He had walked several kilometres over pavements and his varicose ulcer
was throbbing This was the second time in three weeks that he had missed
an evening at the Community Centre a rash act since you could be certain
that the number of your attendances at the Centre was carefully checked In
principle a Party member had no spare time and was never alone except in
bed It was assumed that when he was not working eating or sleeping he
would be taking part in some kind of communal recreation to do anything that
suggested a taste for solitude even to go for a walk by yourself was always
slightly dangerous There was a word for it in Newspeak ownlife it was called
meaning individualism and eccentricity But this evening as he came out of the
Ministry the balminess of the April air had tempted him The sky was a warmer
blue than he had seen it that year and suddenly the long noisy evening at the
Centre the boring exhausting games the lectures the creaking camaraderie
oiled by gin had seemed intolerable On impulse he had turned away from the
busstop and wandered o into the labyrinth of London rst south then east
then north again losing himself among unknown streets and hardly bothering
in which direction he was going
If there is hope he had written in the diary it lies in the proles The words
kept coming back to him statement of a mystical truth and a palpable absurdity
He was somewhere in the vague browncoloured slums to the north and east
of what had once been Saint Pancras Station He was walking up a cobbled
street of little twostorey houses with battered doorways which gave straight on
the pavement and which were somehow curiously suggestive of ratholes There
were puddles of lthy water here and there among the cobbles In and out
of the dark doorways and down narrow alleyways that branched o on either
side people swarmed in astonishing numbers  girls in full bloom with crudely
lipsticked mouths and youths who chased the girls and swollen waddling women
who showed you what the girls would be like in ten years time and old bent
creatures shuing along on splayed feet and ragged barefooted children who
played in the puddles and then scattered at angry yells from their mothers
Perhaps a quarter of the windows in the street were broken and boarded up
Most of the people paid no attention to Winston a few eyed him with a sort

===== Page 49 =====
of guarded curiosity Two monstrous women with brickred forearms folded
across thelr aprons were talking outside a doorway Winston caught scraps of
conversation as he approached
 Yes I says to er thats all very well I says But if youd of been in
my place youd of done the same as what I done Its easy to criticize I says
but you aint got the same problems as what I got 
Ah said the other thats jest it Thats jest where it is
The strident voices stopped abruptly The women studied him in hostile
silence as he went past But it was not hostility exactly merely a kind of
wariness a momentary stiening as at the passing of some unfamiliar animal
The blue overalls of the Party could not be a common sight in a street like this
Indeed it was unwise to be seen in such places unless you had denite business
there The patrols might stop you if you happened to run into them May I
see your papers comrade What are you doing here What time did you leave
work Is this your usual way home  and so on and so forth Not that there
was any rule against walking home by an unusual route but it was enough to
draw attention to you if the Thought Police heard about it
Suddenly the whole street was in commotion There were yells of warning
from all sides People were shooting into the doorways like rabbits A young
woman leapt out of a doorway a little ahead of Winston grabbed up a tiny
child playing in a puddle whipped her apron round it and leapt back again
all in one movement At the same instant a man in a concertinalike black suit
who had emerged from a side alley ran towards Winston pointing excitedly to
the sky
Steamer he yelled Look out guvnor Bang overead Lay down quick
Steamer was a nickname which for some reason the proles applied to
rocket bombs Winston promptly ung himself on his face The proles were
nearly always right when they gave you a warning of this kind They seemed to
possess some kind of instinct which told them several seconds in advance when a
rocket was coming although the rockets supposedly travelled faster than sound
Winston clasped his forearms above his head There was a roar that seemed
to make the pavement heave a shower of light objects pattered on to his back
When he stood up he found that he was covered with fragments of glass from
the nearest window
He walked on The bomb had demolished a group of houses  metres up
the street A black plume of smoke hung in the sky and below it a cloud of
plaster dust in which a crowd was already forming around the ruins There was
a little pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him and in the middle of
it he could see a bright red streak When he got up to it he saw that it was a
human hand severed at the wrist Apart from the bloody stump the hand was
so completely whitened as to resemble a plaster cast
He kicked the thing into the gutter and then to avoid the crowd turned
down a sidestreet to the right Within three or four minutes he was out of the
area which the bomb had aected and the sordid swarming life of the streets
was going on as though nothing had happened It was nearly twenty hours and
the drinkingshops which the proles frequented pubs they called them were
choked with customers From their grimy swing doors endlessly opening and
shutting there came forth a smell of urine sawdust and sour beer In an angle
formed by a projecting housefront three men were standing very close together
the middle one of them holding a foldedup newspaper which the other two were

===== Page 50 =====
studying over his shoulder Even before he was near enough to make out the
expression on their faces Winston could see absorption in every line of their
bodies It was obviously some serious piece of news that they were reading He
was a few paces away from them when suddenly the group broke up and two of
the men were in violent altercation For a moment they seemed almost on the
point of blows
Cant you bleeding well listen to what I say I tell you no number ending
in seven aint won for over fourteen months
Yes it as then
No it as not Back ome I got the ole lot of em for over two years wrote
down on a piece of paper I takes em down reglar as the clock An I tell you
no number ending in seven
Yes a seven as won I could pretty near tell you the bleeding number Four
oh seven it ended in It were in February  second week in February
February your grandmother I got it all down in black and white An I tell
you no number
Oh pack it in said the third man
They were talking about the Lottery Winston looked back when he had
gone thirty metres They were still arguing with vivid passionate faces The
Lottery with its weekly payout of enormous prizes was the one public event
to which the proles paid serious attention It was probable that there were
some millions of proles for whom the Lottery was the principal if not the only
reason for remaining alive It was their delight their folly their anodyne their
intellectual stimulant Where the Lottery was concerned even people who could
barely read and write seemed capable of intricate calculations and staggering
feats of memory There was a whole tribe of men who made a living simply
by selling systems forecasts and lucky amulets Winston had nothing to do
with the running of the Lottery which was managed by the Ministry of Plenty
but he was aware indeed everyone in the party was aware that the prizes were
largely imaginary Only small sums were actually paid out the winners of the big
prizes being nonexistent persons In the absence of any real intercommunication
between one part of Oceania and another this was not dicult to arrange
But if there was hope it lay in the proles You had to cling on to that
When you put it in words it sounded reasonable it was when you looked at
the human beings passing you on the pavement that it became an act of faith
The street into which he had turned ran downhill He had a feeling that he
had been in this neighbourhood before and that there was a main thoroughfare
not far away From somewhere ahead there came a din of shouting voices The
street took a sharp turn and then ended in a ight of steps which led down into
a sunken alley where a few stallkeepers were selling tiredlooking vegetables
At this moment Winston remembered where he was The alley led out into
the main street and down the next turning not ve minutes away was the
junkshop where he had bought the blank book which was now his diary And
in a small stationers shop not far away he had bought his penholder and his
bottle of ink
He paused for a moment at the top of the steps On the opposite side of the
alley there was a dingy little pub whose windows appeared to be frosted over but
in reality were merely coated with dust A very old man bent but active with
white moustaches that bristled forward like those of a prawn pushed open the
swing door and went in As Winston stood watching it occurred to him that

===== Page 51 =====
the old man who must be eighty at the least had already been middleaged
when the Revolution happened He and a few others like him were the last links
that now existed with the vanished world of capitalism In the Party itself there
were not many people left whose ideas had been formed before the Revolution
The older generation had mostly been wiped out in the great purges of the
fties and sixties and the few who survived had long ago been terried into
complete intellectual surrender If there was any one still alive who could give
you a truthful account of conditions in the early part of the century it could
only be a prole Suddenly the passage from the history book that he had copied
into his diary came back into Winstons mind and a lunatic impulse took hold
of him He would go into the pub he would scrape acquaintance with that old
man and question him He would say to him Tell me about your life when you
were a boy What was it like in those days Were things better than they are
now or were they worse
Hurriedly lest he should have time to become frightened he descended the
steps and crossed the narrow street It was madness of course As usual there
was no denite rule against talking to proles and frequenting their pubs but
it was far too unusual an action to pass unnoticed If the patrols appeared he
might plead an attack of faintness but it was not likely that they would believe
him He pushed open the door and a hideous cheesy smell of sour beer hit him
in the face As he entered the din of voices dropped to about half its volume
Behind his back he could feel everyone eyeing his blue overalls A game of darts
which was going on at the other end of the room interrupted itself for perhaps
as much as thirty seconds The old man whom he had followed was standing
at the bar having some kind of altercation with the barman a large stout
hooknosed young man with enormous forearms A knot of others standing
round with glasses in their hands were watching the scene
I arst you civil enough didnt I said the old man straightening his shoul
ders pugnaciously You telling me you aint got a pint mug in the ole bleeding
boozer
And what in hells name is a pint said the barman leaning forward with
the tips of his ngers on the counter
Ark at im Calls isself a barman and dont know what a pint is Why a
pints the alf of a quart and theres four quarts to the gallon Ave to teach
you the A B C next
Never heard of em said the barman shortly Litre and half litre  thats
all we serve Theres the glasses on the shelf in front of you
I likes a pint persisted the old man You could a drawed me o a pint
easy enough We didnt ave these bleeding litres when I was a young man
When you were a young man we were all living in the treetops said the
barman with a glance at the other customers
There was a shout of laughter and the uneasiness caused by Winstons entry
seemed to disappear The old mans whitestubbled face had ushed pink He
turned away muttering to himself and bumped into Winston Winston caught
him gently by the arm
May I oer you a drink he said
Youre a gent said the other straightening his shoulders again He ap
peared not to have noticed Winstons blue overalls Pint he added aggressively
to the barman Pint of wallop
The barman swished two halflitres of darkbrown beer into thick glasses

===== Page 52 =====
which he had rinsed in a bucket under the counter Beer was the only drink you
could get in prole pubs The proles were supposed not to drink gin though in
practice they could get hold of it easily enough The game of darts was in full
swing again and the knot of men at the bar had begun talking about lottery
tickets Winstons presence was forgotten for a moment There was a deal table
under the window where he and the old man could talk without fear of being
overheard It was horribly dangerous but at any rate there was no telescreen
in the room a point he had made sure of as soon as he came in
E could a drawed me o a pint grumbled the old man as he settled down
behind a glass A alf litre aint enough It dont satisfy And a ole litres too
much It starts my bladder running Let alone the price
You must have seen great changes since you were a young man said Win
ston tentatively
The old mans pale blue eyes moved from the darts board to the bar and
from the bar to the door of the Gents as though it were in the barroom that
he expected the changes to have occurred
The beer was better he said nally And cheaper When I was a young
man mild beer  wallop we used to call it  was fourpence a pint That was
before the war of course
Which war was that said Winston
Its all wars said the old man vaguely He took up his glass and his
shoulders straightened again Eres wishing you the very best of ealth
In his lean throat the sharppointed Adams apple made a surprisingly rapid
upanddown movement and the beer vanished Winston went to the bar and
came back with two more halflitres The old man appeared to have forgotten
his prejudice against drinking a full litre
You are very much older than I am said Winston You must have been a
grown man before I was born You can remember what it was like in the old
days before the Revolution People of my age dont really know anything about
those times We can only read about them in books and what it says in the
books may not be true I should like your opinion on that The history books
say that life before the Revolution was completely dierent from what it is now
There was the most terrible oppression injustice poverty worse than anything
we can imagine Here in London the great mass of the people never had enough
to eat from birth to death Half of them hadnt even boots on their feet They
worked twelve hours a day they left school at nine they slept ten in a room
And at the same time there were a very few people only a few thousands 
the capitalists they were called  who were rich and powerful They owned
everything that there was to own They lived in great gorgeous houses with
thirty servants they rode about in motorcars and fourhorse carriages they
drank champagne they wore top hats
The old man brightened suddenly
Top ats he said Funny you should mention em The same thing come
into my ead only yesterday I dono why I was jest thinking I aint seen a top
at in years Gorn right out they ave The last time I wore one was at my
sisterinlaws funeral And that was  well I couldnt give you the date but
it musta been fty years ago Of course it was only ired for the occasion you
understand
It isnt very important about the top hats said Winston patiently The
point is these capitalists  they and a few lawyers and priests and so forth

===== Page 53 =====
who lived on them  were the lords of the earth Everything existed for their
benet You  the ordinary people the workers  were their slaves They
could do what they liked with you They could ship you o to Canada like
cattle They could sleep with your daughters if they chose They could order
you to be ogged with something called a catonine tails You had to take
your cap o when you passed them Every capitalist went about with a gang of
lackeys who
The old man brightened again
Lackeys he said Now theres a word I aint eard since ever so long
Lackeys That reglar takes me back that does I recollect oh donkeys years
ago  I used to sometimes go to Yde Park of a Sunday afternoon to ear the
blokes making speeches Salvation Army Roman Catholics Jews Indians  all
sorts there was And there was one bloke  well I couldnt give you is name
but a real powerful speaker e was E didnt alf give it em Lackeys e says
lackeys of the bourgeoisie Flunkies of the ruling class Parasites  that was
another of them And yenas  e denitely called em yenas Of course e was
referring to the Labour Party you understand
Winston had the feeling that they were talking at crosspurposes
What I really wanted to know was this he said Do you feel that you have
more freedom now than you had in those days Are you treated more like a
human being In the old days the rich people the people at the top
The Ouse of Lords put in the old man reminiscently
The House of Lords if you like What I am asking is were these people able
to treat you as an inferior simply because they were rich and you were poor
Is it a fact for instance that you had to call them Sir and take o your cap
when you passed them
The old man appeared to think deeply He drank o about a quarter of his
beer before answering
Yes he said They liked you to touch your cap to em It showed respect
like I didnt agree with it myself but I done it often enough Had to as you
might say
And was it usual  Im only quoting what Ive read in history books 
was it usual for these people and their servants to push you o the pavement
into the gutter
One of em pushed me once said the old man I recollect it as if it was
yesterday It was Boat Race night  terribly rowdy they used to get on Boat
Race night  and I bumps into a young bloke on Shaftesbury Avenue Quite
a gent e was  dress shirt top at black overcoat E was kind of zigzagging
across the pavement and I bumps into im accidentallike E says Why cant
you look where youre going e says I say Ju think youve bought the
bleeding pavement E says Ill twist your bloody ead o if you get fresh
with me I says Youre drunk Ill give you in charge in alf a minute I says
An if youll believe me e puts is and on my chest and gives me a shove as
pretty near sent me under the wheels of a bus Well I was young in them days
and I was going to ave fetched im one only
A sense of helplessness took hold of Winston The old mans memory was
nothing but a rubbishheap of details One could question him all day without
getting any real information The party histories might still be true after a
fashion they might even be completely true He made a last attempt

===== Page 54 =====
Perhaps I have not made myself clear he said What Im trying to say is
this You have been alive a very long time you lived half your life before the
Revolution In  for instance you were already grown up Would you say
from what you can remember that life in  was better than it is now or
worse If you could choose would you prefer to live then or now
The old man looked meditatively at the darts board He nished up his beer
more slowly than before When he spoke it was with a tolerant philosophical
air as though the beer had mellowed him
I know what you expect me to say he said You expect me to say as Id
sooner be young again Most peopled say theyd sooner be young if you arst
em You got your ealth and strength when youre young When you get to
my time of life you aint never well I suer something wicked from my feet
and my bladders jest terrible Six and seven times a night it as me out of bed
On the other and theres great advantages in being a old man You aint got
the same worries No truck with women and thats a great thing I aint ad a
woman for near on thirty year if youd credit it Nor wanted to whats more
Winston sat back against the windowsill It was no use going on He was
about to buy some more beer when the old man suddenly got up and shued
rapidly into the stinking urinal at the side of the room The extra halflitre was
already working on him Winston sat for a minute or two gazing at his empty
glass and hardly noticed when his feet carried him out into the street again
Within twenty years at the most he reected the huge and simple question
Was life better before the Revolution than it is now would have ceased once
and for all to be answerable But in eect it was unanswerable even now since
the few scattered survivors from the ancient world were incapable of comparing
one age with another They remembered a million useless things a quarrel
with a workmate a hunt for a lost bicycle pump the expression on a longdead
sisters face the swirls of dust on a windy morning seventy years ago but all
the relevant facts were outside the range of their vision They were like the ant
which can see small objects but not large ones And when memory failed and
written records were falsied  when that happened the claim of the Party
to have improved the conditions of human life had got to be accepted because
there did not exist and never again could exist any standard against which it
could be tested
At this moment his train of thought stopped abruptly He halted and looked
up He was in a narrow street with a few dark little shops interspersed among
dwellinghouses Immediately above his head there hung three discoloured metal
balls which looked as if they had once been gilded He seemed to know the
place Of course He was standing outside the junkshop where he had bought
the diary
A twinge of fear went through him It had been a suciently rash act to buy
the book in the beginning and he had sworn never to come near the place again
And yet the instant that he allowed his thoughts to wander his feet had brought
him back here of their own accord It was precisely against suicidal impulses of
this kind that he had hoped to guard himself by opening the diary At the same
time he noticed that although it was nearly twentyone hours the shop was still
open With the feeling that he would be less conspicuous inside than hanging
about on the pavement he stepped through the doorway If questioned he
could plausibly say that he was trying to buy razor blades
The proprietor had just lighted a hanging oil lamp which gave o an unclean

===== Page 55 =====
but friendly smell He was a man of perhaps sixty frail and bowed with a long
benevolent nose and mild eyes distorted by thick spectacles His hair was
almost white but his eyebrows were bushy and still black His spectacles his
gentle fussy movements and the fact that he was wearing an aged jacket of
black velvet gave him a vague air of intellectuality as though he had been some
kind of literary man or perhaps a musician His voice was soft as though faded
and his accent less debased than that of the majority of proles
I recognized you on the pavement he said immediately Youre the gentle
man that bought the young ladys keepsake album That was a beautiful bit of
paper that was Cream laid it used to be called Theres been no paper like
that made for  oh I dare say fty years He peered at Winston over the top
of his spectacles Is there anything special I can do for you Or did you just
want to look round
I was passing said Winston vaguely I just looked in I dont want anything
in particular
Its just as well said the other because I dont suppose I could have sat
ised you He made an apologetic gesture with his softpalmed hand You see
how it is an empty shop you might say Between you and me the antique
trades just about nished No demand any longer and no stock either Furni
ture china glass its all been broken up by degrees And of course the metal
stus mostly been melted down I havent seen a brass candlestick in years
The tiny interior of the shop was in fact uncomfortably full but there was
almost nothing in it of the slightest value The oorspace was very restricted
because all round the walls were stacked innumerable dusty pictureframes In
the window there were trays of nuts and bolts wornout chisels penknives with
broken blades tarnished watches that did not even pretend to be in going order
and other miscellaneous rubbish Only on a small table in the corner was there a
litter of odds and ends  lacquered snuboxes agate brooches and the like 
which looked as though they might include something interesting As Winston
wandered towards the table his eye was caught by a round smooth thing that
gleamed softly in the lamplight and he picked it up
It was a heavy lump of glass curved on one side at on the other making
almost a hemisphere There was a peculiar softness as of rainwater in both the
colour and the texture of the glass At the heart of it magnied by the curved
surface there was a strange pink convoluted object that recalled a rose or a
sea anemone
What is it said Winston fascinated
Thats coral that is said the old man It must have come from the Indian
Ocean They used to kind of embed it in the glass That wasnt made less than
a hundred years ago More by the look of it
Its a beautiful thing said Winston
It is a beautiful thing said the other appreciatively But theres not many
thatd say so nowadays He coughed Now if it so happened that you wanted
to buy it thatd cost you four dollars I can remember when a thing like that
would have fetched eight pounds and eight pounds was  well I cant work it
out but it was a lot of money But who cares about genuine antiques nowadays
even the few thats left
Winston immediately paid over the four dollars and slid the coveted thing
into his pocket What appealed to him about it was not so much its beauty
as the air it seemed to possess of belonging to an age quite dierent from the

===== Page 56 =====
present one The soft rainwatery glass was not like any glass that he had
ever seen The thing was doubly attractive because of its apparent uselessness
though he could guess that it must once have been intended as a paperweight
It was very heavy in his pocket but fortunately it did not make much of a bulge
It was a queer thing even a compromising thing for a Party member to have
in his possession Anything old and for that matter anything beautiful was
always vaguely suspect The old man had grown noticeably more cheerful after
receiving the four dollars Winston realized that he would have accepted three
or even two
Theres another room upstairs that you might care to take a look at he
said Theres not much in it Just a few pieces Well do with a light if were
going upstairs
He lit another lamp and with bowed back led the way slowly up the steep
and worn stairs and along a tiny passage into a room which did not give on the
street but looked out on a cobbled yard and a forest of chimneypots Winston
noticed that the furniture was still arranged as though the room were meant to
be lived in There was a strip of carpet on the oor a picture or two on the walls
and a deep slatternly armchair drawn up to the replace An oldfashioned
glass clock with a twelvehour face was ticking away on the mantelpiece Under
the window and occupying nearly a quarter of the room was an enormous bed
with the mattress still on it
We lived here till my wife died said the old man half apologetically Im
selling the furniture o by little and little Now thats a beautiful mahogany
bed or at least it would be if you could get the bugs out of it But I dare say
youd nd it a little bit cumbersome
He was holdlng the lamp high up so as to illuminate the whole room and
in the warm dim light the place looked curiously inviting The thought itted
through Winstons mind that it would probably be quite easy to rent the room
for a few dollars a week if he dared to take the risk It was a wild impossible
notion to be abandoned as soon as thought of but the room had awakened in
him a sort of nostalgia a sort of ancestral memory It seemed to him that he
knew exactly what it felt like to sit in a room like this in an armchair beside
an open re with your feet in the fender and a kettle on the hob utterly alone
utterly secure with nobody watching you no voice pursuing you no sound
except the singing of the kettle and the friendly ticking of the clock
Theres no telescreen he could not help murmuring
Ah said the old man I never had one of those things Too expensive And
I never seemed to feel the need of it somehow Now thats a nice gateleg table
in the corner there Though of course youd have to put new hinges on it if you
wanted to use the aps
There was a small bookcase in the other corner and Winston had already
gravitated towards it It contained nothing but rubbish The huntingdown and
destruction of books had been done with the same thoroughness in the prole
quarters as everywhere else It was very unlikely that there existed anywhere in
Oceania a copy of a book printed earlier than  The old man still carrying
the lamp was standing in front of a picture in a rosewood frame which hung on
the other side of the replace opposite the bed
Now if you happen to be interested in old prints at all  he began delicately
Winston came across to examine the picture It was a steel engraving of
an oval building with rectangular windows and a small tower in front There

===== Page 57 =====
was a railing running round the building and at the rear end there was what
appeared to be a statue Winston gazed at it for some moments It seemed
vaguely familiar though he did not remember the statue
The frames xed to the wall said the old man but I could unscrew it for
you I dare say
I know that building said Winston nally Its a ruin now Its in the
middle of the street outside the Palace of Justice
Thats right Outside the Law Courts It was bombed in  oh many years
ago It was a church at one time St Clements Danes its name was He smiled
apologetically as though conscious of saying something slightly ridiculous and
added Oranges and lemons say the bells of St Clements
Whats that said Winston
OhOranges and lemons say the bells of St Clements That was a rhyme
we had when I was a little boy How it goes on I dont remember but I do know
it ended up Here comes a candle to light you to bed Here comes a chopper
to chop o your head It was a kind of a dance They held out their arms for
you to pass under and when they came to Here comes a chopper to chop o
your head they brought their arms down and caught you It was just names of
churches All the London churches were in it  all the principal ones that is
Winston wondered vaguely to what century the church belonged It was
always dicult to determine the age of a London building Anything large and
impressive if it was reasonably new in appearance was automatically claimed
as having been built since the Revolution while anything that was obviously
of earlier date was ascribed to some dim period called the Middle Ages The
centuries of capitalism were held to have produced nothing of any value One
could not learn history from architecture any more than one could learn it from
books Statues inscriptions memorial stones the names of streets  anything
that might throw light upon the past had been systematically altered
I never knew it had been a church he said
Theres a lot of them left really said the old man though theyve been
put to other uses Now how did that rhyme go Ah Ive got it
Oranges and lemons say the bells of St Clements
You owe me three farthings say the bells of St Martins
 there now thats as far as I can get
A farthing that was a small copper coin
looked something like a cent
Where was St Martins said Winston
St Martins Thats still standing Its in Victory Square alongside the
picture gallery A building with a kind of a triangular porch and pillars in front
and a big ight of steps
Winston knew the place well It was a museum used for propaganda dis
plays of various kinds  scale models of rocket bombs and Floating Fortresses
waxwork tableaux illustrating enemy atrocities and the like
St MartinsintheFields it used to be called supplemented the old man
though I dont recollect any elds anywhere in those parts
Winston did not buy the picture It would have been an even more incon
gruous possession than the glass paperweight and impossible to carry home
unless it were taken out of its frame But he lingered for some minutes more
talking to the old man whose name he discovered was not Weeksas one might
have gathered from the inscription over the shopfront  but Charrington Mr

===== Page 58 =====
Charrington it seemed was a widower aged sixtythree and had inhabited this
shop for thirty years Throughout that time he had been intending to alter the
name over the window but had never quite got to the point of doing it All the
while that they were talking the halfremembered rhyme kept running through
Winstons head Oranges and lemons say the bells of St Clements You owe me
three farthings say the bells of St Martins It was curious but when you said
it to yourself you had the illusion of actually hearing bells the bells of a lost
London that still existed somewhere or other disguised and forgotten From
one ghostly steeple after another he seemed to hear them pealing forth Yet so
far as he could remember he had never in real life heard church bells ringing
He got away from Mr Charrington and went down the stairs alone so as
not to let the old man see him reconnoitring the street before stepping out of
the door He had already made up his mind that after a suitable interval  a
month say  he would take the risk of visiting the shop again It was perhaps
not more dangerous than shirking an evening at the Centre The serious piece
of folly had been to come back here in the rst place after buying the diary and
without knowing whether the proprietor of the shop could be trusted However
Yes he thought again he would come back He would buy further scraps of
beautiful rubbish He would buy the engraving of St Clements Danes take it
out of its frame and carry it home concealed under the jacket of his overalls
He would drag the rest of that poem out of Mr Charringtons memory Even
the lunatic project of renting the room upstairs ashed momentarily through
his mind again For perhaps ve seconds exaltation made him careless and
he stepped out on to the pavement without so much as a preliminary glance
through the window He had even started humming to an improvised tune
Oranges and lemons say the bells of St Clements You owe me three far
things say the
Suddenly his heart seemed to turn to ice and his bowels to water A gure
in blue overalls was coming down the pavement not ten metres away It was
the girl from the Fiction Department the girl with dark hair The light was
failing but there was no diculty in recognizing her She looked him straight
in the face then walked quickly on as though she had not seen him
For a few seconds Winston was too paralysed to move Then he turned to
the right and walked heavily away not noticing for the moment that he was
going in the wrong direction At any rate one question was settled There was
no doubting any longer that the girl was spying on him She must have followed
him here because it was not credible that by pure chance she should have
happened to be walking on the same evening up the same obscure backstreet
kilometres distant from any quarter where Party members lived It was too
great a coincidence Whether she was really an agent of the Thought Police
or simply an amateur spy actuated by ociousness hardly mattered It was
enough that she was watching him Probably she had seen him go into the pub
as well
It was an eort to walk The lump of glass in his pocket banged against his
thigh at each step and he was half minded to take it out and throw it away
The worst thing was the pain in his belly For a couple of minutes he had the
feeling that he would die if he did not reach a lavatory soon But there would
be no public lavatories in a quarter like this Then the spasm passed leaving a
dull ache behind
The street was a blind alley Winston halted stood for several seconds

===== Page 59 =====
wondering vaguely what to do then turned round and began to retrace his
steps As he turned it occurred to him that the girl had only passed him three
minutes ago and that by running he could probably catch up with her He could
keep on her track till they were in some quiet place and then smash her skull
in with a cobblestone The piece of glass in his pocket would be heavy enough
for the job But he abandoned the idea immediately because even the thought
of making any physical eort was unbearable He could not run he could not
strike a blow Besides she was young and lusty and would defend herself He
thought also of hurrying to the Community Centre and staying there till the
place closed so as to establish a partial alibi for the evening But that too was
impossible A deadly lassitude had taken hold of him All he wanted was to get
home quickly and then sit down and be quiet
It was after twentytwo hours when he got back to the at The lights would
be switched o at the main at twentythree thirty He went into the kitchen and
swallowed nearly a teacupful of Victory Gin Then he went to the table in the
alcove sat down and took the diary out of the drawer But he did not open
it at once From the telescreen a brassy female voice was squalling a patriotic
song He sat staring at the marbled cover of the book trying without success
to shut the voice out of his consciousness
It was at night that they came for you always at night The proper thing
was to kill yourself before they got you Undoubtedly some people did so Many
of the disappearances were actually suicides But it needed desperate courage
to kill yourself in a world where rearms or any quick and certain poison
were completely unprocurable He thought with a kind of astonishment of the
biological uselessness of pain and fear the treachery of the human body which
always freezes into inertia at exactly the moment when a special eort is needed
He might have silenced the darkhaired girl if only he had acted quickly enough
but precisely because of the extremity of his danger he had lost the power to act
It struck him that in moments of crisis one is never ghting against an external
enemy but always against ones own body Even now in spite of the gin the
dull ache in his belly made consecutive thought impossible And it is the same
he perceived in all seemingly heroic or tragic situations On the battleeld
in the torture chamber on a sinking ship the issues that you are ghting for
are always forgotten because the body swells up until it lls the universe and
even when you are not paralysed by fright or screaming with pain life is a
momenttomoment struggle against hunger or cold or sleeplessness against a
sour stomach or an aching tooth
He opened the diary It was important to write something down The woman
on the telescreen had started a new song Her voice seemed to stick into his
brain like jagged splinters of glass He tried to think of OBrien for whom or
to whom the diary was written but instead he began thinking of the things
that would happen to him after the Thought Police took him away It would
not matter if they killed you at once To be killed was what you expected But
before death nobody spoke of such things yet everybody knew of them there
was the routine of confession that had to be gone through the grovelling on the
oor and screaming for mercy the crack of broken bones the smashed teeth
and bloody clots of hair
Why did you have to endure it since the end was always the same Why was
it not possible to cut a few days or weeks out of your life Nobody ever escaped
detection and nobody ever failed to confess When once you had succumbed to

===== Page 60 =====
thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given date you would be dead Why then
did that horror which altered nothing have to lie embedded in future time
He tried with a little more success than before to summon up the image of
OBrien We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness OBrien had
said to him He knew what it meant or thought he knew The place where
there is no darkness was the imagined future which one would never see but
which by foreknowledge one could mystically share in But with the voice
from the telescreen nagging at his ears he could not follow the train of thought
further He put a cigarette in his mouth Half the tobacco promptly fell out on
to his tongue a bitter dust which was dicult to spit out again The face of Big
Brother swam into his mind displacing that of OBrien Just as he had done
a few days earlier he slid a coin out of his pocket and looked at it The face
gazed up at him heavy calm protecting but what kind of smile was hidden
beneath the dark moustache Like a leaden knell the words came back at him
WAR IS PEACE
FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH

Chapter 
It was the middle of the morning and Winston had left the cubicle to go to the
lavatory
A solitary gure was coming towards him from the other end of the long
brightlylit corridor It was the girl with dark hair Four days had gone past
since the evening when he had run into her outside the junkshop As she came
nearer he saw that her right arm was in a sling not noticeable at a distance
because it was of the same colour as her overalls Probably she had crushed her
hand while swinging round one of the big kaleidoscopes on which the plots of
novels were roughed in It was a common accident in the Fiction Department
They were perhaps four metres apart when the girl stumbled and fell almost
at on her face A sharp cry of pain was wrung out of her She must have
fallen right on the injured arm Winston stopped short The girl had risen to
her knees Her face had turned a milky yellow colour against which her mouth
stood out redder than ever Her eyes were xed on his with an appealing
expression that looked more like fear than pain
A curious emotion stirred in Winstons heart In front of him was an enemy
who was trying to kill him in front of him also was a human creature in pain
and perhaps with a broken bone Already he had instinctively started forward
to help her In the moment when he had seen her fall on the bandaged arm it
had been as though he felt the pain in his own body
Youre hurt he said
Its nothing My arm Itll be all right in a second
She spoke as though her heart were uttering She had certainly turned very
pale
You havent broken anything
No Im all right It hurt for a moment thats all
She held out her free hand to him and he helped her up She had regained
some of her colour and appeared very much better
Its nothing she repeated shortly I only gave my wrist a bit of a bang
Thanks comrade
And with that she walked on in the direction in which she had been going as
briskly as though it had really been nothing The whole incident could not have
taken as much as half a minute Not to let ones feelings appear in ones face was
a habit that had acquired the status of an instinct and in any case they had been
standing straight in front of a telescreen when the thing happened Nevertheless
it had been very dicult not to betray a momentary surprise for in the two
or three seconds while he was helping her up the girl had slipped something

===== Page 62 =====
into his hand There was no question that she had done it intentionally It was
something small and at As he passed through the lavatory door he transferred
it to his pocket and felt it with the tips of his ngers It was a scrap of paper
folded into a square
While he stood at the urinal he managed with a little more ngering to
get it unfolded Obviously there must be a message of some kind written on
it For a moment he was tempted to take it into one of the waterclosets and
read it at once But that would be shocking folly as he well knew There was
no place where you could be more certain that the telescreens were watched
continuously
He went back to his cubicle sat down threw the fragment of paper casually
among the other papers on the desk put on his spectacles and hitched the
speakwrite towards him ve minutes he told himself ve minutes at the very
least His heart bumped in his breast with frightening loudness Fortunately
the piece of work he was engaged on was mere routine the rectication of a
long list of gures not needing close attention
Whatever was written on the paper it must have some kind of political
meaning So far as he could see there were two possibilities One much the
more likely was that the girl was an agent of the Thought Police just as he had
feared He did not know why the Thought Police should choose to deliver their
messages in such a fashion but perhaps they had their reasons The thing that
was written on the paper might be a threat a summons an order to commit
suicide a trap of some description But there was another wilder possibility
that kept raising its head though he tried vainly to suppress it This was that
the message did not come from the Thought Police at all but from some kind of
underground organization Perhaps the Brotherhood existed after all Perhaps
the girl was part of it No doubt the idea was absurd but it had sprung into his
mind in the very instant of feeling the scrap of paper in his hand It was not till a
couple of minutes later that the other more probable explanation had occurred
to him And even now though his intellect told him that the message probably
meant death  still that was not what he believed and the unreasonable hope
persisted and his heart banged and it was with diculty that he kept his voice
from trembling as he murmured his gures into the speakwrite
He rolled up the completed bundle of work and slid it into the pneumatic
tube Eight minutes had gone by He readjusted his spectacles on his nose
sighed and drew the next batch of work towards him with the scrap of paper
on top of it He attened it out On it was written in a large unformed
handwriting
I love you
For several seconds he was too stunned even to throw the incriminating thing
into the memory hole When he did so although he knew very well the danger
of showing too much interest he could not resist reading it once again just to
make sure that the words were really there
For the rest of the morning it was very dicult to work What was even
worse than having to focus his mind on a series of niggling jobs was the need to
conceal his agitation from the telescreen He felt as though a re were burning
in his belly Lunch in the hot crowded noiselled canteen was torment He
had hoped to be alone for a little while during the lunch hour but as bad luck
would have it the imbecile Parsons opped down beside him the tang of his
sweat almost defeating the tinny smell of stew and kept up a stream of talk

===== Page 63 =====
about the preparations for Hate Week He was particularly enthusiastic about
a papierm ach e model of Big Brothers head two metres wide which was being
made for the occasion by his daughters troop of Spies The irritating thing was
that in the racket of voices Winston could hardly hear what Parsons was saying
and was constantly having to ask for some fatuous remark to be repeated Just
once he caught a glimpse of the girl at a table with two other girls at the far
end of the room She appeared not to have seen him and he did not look in
that direction again
The afternoon was more bearable Immediately after lunch there arrived a
delicate dicult piece of work which would take several hours and necessitated
putting everything else aside It consisted in falsifying a series of production
reports of two years ago in such a way as to cast discredit on a prominent
member of the Inner Party who was now under a cloud This was the kind
of thing that Winston was good at and for more than two hours he succeeded
in shutting the girl out of his mind altogether Then the memory of her face
came back and with it a raging intolerable desire to be alone Until he could
be alone it was impossible to think this new development out Tonight was
one of his nights at the Community Centre He wolfed another tasteless meal
in the canteen hurried o to the Centre took part in the solemn foolery of a
discussion group played two games of table tennis swallowed several glasses
of gin and sat for half an hour through a lecture entitled Ingsoc in relation to
chess His soul writhed with boredom but for once he had had no impulse to
shirk his evening at the Centre At the sight of the words I love you the desire to
stay alive had welled up in him and the taking of minor risks suddenly seemed
stupid It was not till twentythree hours when he was home and in bed  in
the darkness where you were safe even from the telescreen so long as you kept
silent  that he was able to think continuously
It was a physical problem that had to be solved how to get in touch with
the girl and arrange a meeting He did not consider any longer the possibility
that she might be laying some kind of trap for him He knew that it was
not so because of her unmistakable agitation when she handed him the note
Obviously she had been frightened out of her wits as well she might be Nor
did the idea of refusing her advances even cross his mind Only ve nights ago
he had contemplated smashing her skull in with a cobblestone but that was
of no importance He thought of her naked youthful body as he had seen it
in his dream He had imagined her a fool like all the rest of them her head
stued with lies and hatred her belly full of ice A kind of fever seized him at
the thought that he might lose her the white youthful body might slip away
from him What he feared more than anything else was that she would simply
change her mind if he did not get in touch with her quickly But the physical
diculty of meeting was enormous It was like trying to make a move at chess
when you were already mated Whichever way you turned the telescreen faced
you Actually all the possible ways of communicating with her had occurred
to him within ve minutes of reading the note but now with time to think
he went over them one by one as though laying out a row of instruments on a
table
Obviously the kind of encounter that had happened this morning could not
be repeated If she had worked in the Records Department it might have been
comparatively simple but he had only a very dim idea whereabouts in the
building the Fiction Departrnent lay and he had no pretext for going there If

===== Page 64 =====
he had known where she lived and at what time she left work he could have
contrived to meet her somewhere on her way home but to try to follow her
home was not safe because it would mean loitering about outside the Ministry
which was bound to be noticed As for sending a letter through the mails it
was out of the question By a routine that was not even secret all letters were
opened in transit Actually few people ever wrote letters For the messages
that it was occasionally necessary to send there were printed postcards with
long lists of phrases and you struck out the ones that were inapplicable In any
case he did not know the girls name let alone her address Finally he decided
that the safest place was the canteen If he could get her at a table by herself
somewhere in the middle of the room not too near the telescreens and with a
sucient buzz of conversation all round  if these conditions endured for say
thirty seconds it might be possible to exchange a few words
For a week after this life was like a restless dream On the next day she did
not appear in the canteen until he was leaving it the whistle having already
blown Presumably she had been changed on to a later shift They passed each
other without a glance On the day after that she was in the canteen at the usual
time but with three other girls and immediately under a telescreen Then for
three dreadful days she did not appear at all His whole mind and body seemed
to be aicted with an unbearable sensitivity a sort of transparency which made
every movement every sound every contact every word that he had to speak
or listen to an agony Even in sleep he could not altogether escape from her
image He did not touch the diary during those days If there was any relief it
was in his work in which he could sometimes forget himself for ten minutes at
a stretch He had absolutely no clue as to what had happened to her There
was no enquiry he could make She might have been vaporized she might have
committed suicide she might have been transferred to the other end of Oceania
worst and likeliest of all she might simply have changed her mind and decided
to avoid him
The next day she reappeared Her arm was out of the sling and she had
a band of stickingplaster round her wrist The relief of seeing her was so
great that he could not resist staring directly at her for several seconds On
the following day he very nearly succeeded in speaking to her When he came
into the canteen she was sitting at a table well out from the wall and was
quite alone It was early and the place was not very full The queue edged
forward till Winston was almost at the counter then was held up for two minutes
because someone in front was complaining that he had not received his tablet
of saccharine But the girl was still alone when Winston secured his tray and
began to make for her table He walked casually towards her his eyes searching
for a place at some table beyond her She was perhaps three metres away from
him Another two seconds would do it Then a voice behind him called Smith
He pretended not to hear Smith repeated the voice more loudly It was no
use He turned round A blondheaded sillyfaced young man named Wilsher
whom he barely knew was inviting him with a smile to a vacant place at his
table It was not safe to refuse After having been recognized he could not
go and sit at a table with an unattended girl It was too noticeable He sat
down with a friendly smile The silly blond face beamed into his Winston had
a hallucination of himself smashing a pickaxe right into the middle of it The
girls table lled up a few minutes later
But she must have seen him coming towards her and perhaps she would

===== Page 65 =====
take the hint Next day he took care to arrive early Surely enough she was
at a table in about the same place and again alone The person immediately
ahead of him in the queue was a small swiftlymoving beetlelike man with a
at face and tiny suspicious eyes As Winston turned away from the counter
with his tray he saw that the little man was making straight for the girls table
His hopes sank again There was a vacant place at a table further away but
something in the little mans appearance suggested that he would be suciently
attentive to his own comfort to choose the emptiest table With ice at his heart
Winston followed It was no use unless he could get the girl alone At this
moment there was a tremendous crash The little man was sprawling on all
fours his tray had gone ying two streams of soup and coee were owing
across the oor He started to his feet with a malignant glance at Winston
whom he evidently suspected of having tripped him up But it was all right
Five seconds later with a thundering heart Winston was sitting at the girls
table
He did not look at her He unpacked his tray and promptly began eating It
was allimportant to speak at once before anyone else came but now a terrible
fear had taken possession of him A week had gone by since she had rst
approached him She would have changed her mind she must have changed
her mind It was impossible that this aair should end successfully such things
did not happen in real life He might have inched altogether from speaking if
at this moment he had not seen Ampleforth the hairyeared poet wandering
limply round the room with a tray looking for a place to sit down In his vague
way Ampleforth was attached to Winston and would certainly sit down at his
table if he caught sight of him There was perhaps a minute in which to act
Both Winston and the girl were eating steadily The stu they were eating was
a thin stew actually a soup of haricot beans In a low murmur Winston began
speaking Neither of them looked up steadily they spooned the watery stu
into their mouths and between spoonfuls exchanged the few necessary words
in low expressionless voices
What time do you leave work
Eighteenthirty
Where can we meet
Victory Square near the monument
Its full of telescreens
It doesnt matter if theres a crowd
Any signal
No Dont come up to me until you see me among a lot of people And
dont look at me Just keep somewhere near me
What time
Nineteen hours
All right
Ampleforth failed to see Winston and sat down at another table They did
not speak again and so far as it was possible for two people sitting on opposite
sides of the same table they did not look at one another The girl nished her
lunch quickly and made o while Winston stayed to smoke a cigarette
Winston was in Victory Square before the appointed time He wandered
round the base of the enormous uted column at the top of which Big Brothers
statue gazed southward towards the skies where he had vanquished the Eurasian
aeroplanes the Eastasian aeroplanes it had been a few years ago in the Battle

===== Page 66 =====
of Airstrip One In the street in front of it there was a statue of a man on
horseback which was supposed to represent Oliver Cromwell At ve minutes
past the hour the girl had still not appeared Again the terrible fear seized upon
Winston She was not coming she had changed her mind He walked slowly
up to the north side of the square and got a sort of palecoloured pleasure from
identifying St Martins Church whose bells when it had bells had chimed
You owe me three farthings Then he saw the girl standing at the base of
the monument reading or pretending to read a poster which ran spirally up the
column It was not safe to go near her until some more people had accumulated
There were telescreens all round the pediment But at this moment there was
a din of shouting and a zoom of heavy vehicles from somewhere to the left
Suddenly everyone seemed to be running across the square The girl nipped
nimbly round the lions at the base of the monument and joined in the rush
Winston followed As he ran he gathered from some shouted remarks that a
convoy of Eurasian prisoners was passing
Already a dense mass of people was blocking the south side of the square
Winston at normal times the kind of person who gravitates to the outer edge
of any kind of scrimmage shoved butted squirmed his way forward into the
heart of the crowd Soon he was within arms length of the girl but the way
was blocked by an enormous prole and an almost equally enormous woman
presumably his wife who seemed to form an impenetrable wall of esh Win
ston wriggled himself sideways and with a violent lunge managed to drive his
shoulder between them For a moment it felt as though his entrails were being
ground to pulp between the two muscular hips then he had broken through
sweating a little He was next to the girl They were shoulder to shoulder both
staring xedly in front of them
A long line of trucks with woodenfaced guards armed with submachine
guns standing upright in each corner was passing slowly down the street In
the trucks little yellow men in shabby greenish uniforms were squatting jammed
close together Their sad Mongolian faces gazed out over the sides of the trucks
utterly incurious Occasionally when a truck jolted there was a clankclank of
metal all the prisoners were wearing legirons Truckload after truckload of
the sad faces passed Winston knew they were there but he saw them only
intermittently The girls shoulder and her arm right down to the elbow were
pressed against his Her cheek was almost near enough for him to feel its warmth
She had immediately taken charge of the situation just as she had done in the
canteen She began speaking in the same expressionless voice as before with
lips barely moving a mere murmur easily drowned by the din of voices and the
rumbling of the trucks
Can you hear me
Yes
Can you get Sunday afternoon o
Yes
Then listen carefully Youll have to remember this Go to Paddington
Station
With a sort of military precision that astonished him she outlined the route
that he was to follow A halfhour railway journey turn left outside the station
two kilometres along the road a gate with the top bar missing a path across a
eld a grassgrown lane a track between bushes a dead tree with moss on it
It was as though she had a map inside her head Can you remember all that

===== Page 67 =====
she murmured nally
Yes
You turn left then right then left again And the gates got no top bar
Yes What time
About fteen You may have to wait Ill get there by another way Are
you sure you remember everything
Yes
Then get away from me as quick as you can
She need not have told him that But for the moment they could not ex
tricate themselves from the crowd The trucks were still ling post the people
still insatiably gaping At the start there had been a few boos and hisses but
it came only from the Party members among the crowd and had soon stopped
The prevailing emotion was simply curiosity Foreigners whether from Eura
sia or from Eastasia were a kind of strange animal One literally never saw
them except in the guise of prisoners and even as prisoners one never got more
than a momentary glimpse of them Nor did one know what became of them
apart from the few who were hanged as warcriminals te others simply van
ished presumably into forcedlabour camps The round Mogol faces had given
way to faces of a more European type dirty bearded and exhausted From
over scrubby cheekbones eyes looked into Winstons sometimes with strange
intensity and ashed away again The convoy was drawing to an end In the
last truck he could see an aged man his face a mass of grizzled hair standing
upright with wrists crossed in front of him as though he were used to having
them bound together It was almost time for Winston and the girl to part But
at the last moment while the crowd still hemmed them in her hand felt for his
and gave it a eeting squeeze
It could not have been ten seconds and yet it seemed a long time that their
hands were clasped together He had time to learn every detail of her hand
He explored the long ngers the shapely nails the workhardened palm with
its row of callouses the smooth esh under the wrist Merely from feeling it he
would have known it by sight In the same instant it occurred to him that he
did not know what colour the girls eyes were They were probably brown but
people with dark hair sometimes had blue eyes To turn his head and look at
her would have been inconceivable folly With hands locked together invisible
among the press of bodies they stared steadily in front of them and instead of
the eyes of the girl the eyes of the aged prisoner gazed mournfully at Winston
out of nests of hair

Chapter 
Winston picked his way up the lane through dappled light and shade stepping
out into pools of gold wherever the boughs parted Under the trees to the left
of him the ground was misty with bluebells The air seemed to kiss ones skin
It was the second of May From somewhere deeper in the heart of the wood
came the droning of ring doves
He was a bit early There had been no diculties about the journey and
the girl was so evidently experienced that he was less frightened than he would
normally have been Presumably she could be trusted to nd a safe place In
general you could not assume that you were much safer in the country than in
London There were no telescreens of course but there was always the danger
of concealed microphones by which your voice might be picked up and recog
nized besides it was not easy to make a journey by yourself without attracting
attention For distances of less than  kilometres it was not necessary to get
your passport endorsed but sometimes there were patrols hanging about the
railway stations who examined the papers of any Party member they found
there and asked awkward questions However no patrols had appeared and on
the walk from the station he had made sure by cautious backward glances that
he was not being followed The train was full of proles in holiday mood because
of the summery weather The woodenseated carriage in which he travelled was
lled to overowing by a single enormous family ranging from a toothless
greatgrandmother to a monthold baby going out to spend an afternoon with
inlaws in the country and as they freely explained to Winston to get hold
of a little blackmarket butter
The lane widened and in a minute he came to the footpath she had told him
of a mere cattletrack which plunged between the bushes He had no watch
but it could not be fteen yet The bluebells were so thick underfoot that it was
impossible not to tread on them He knelt down and began picking some partly
to pass the time away but also from a vague idea that he would like to have a
bunch of owers to oer to the girl when they met He had got together a big
bunch and was smelling their faint sickly scent when a sound at his back froze
him the unmistakable crackle of a foot on twigs He went on picking bluebells
It was the best thing to do It might be the girl or he might have been followed
after all To look round was to show guilt He picked another and another A
hand fell lightly on his shoulder
He looked up It was the girl She shook her head evidently as a warning
that he must keep silent then parted the bushes and quickly led the way along
the narrow track into the wood Obviously she had been that way before for

===== Page 69 =====
she dodged the boggy bits as though by habit Winston followed still clasping
his bunch of owers His rst feeling was relief but as he watched the strong
slender body moving in front of him with the scarlet sash that was just tight
enough to bring out the curve of her hips the sense of his own inferiority was
heavy upon him Even now it seemed quite likely that when she turned round
and looked at him she would draw back after all The sweetness of the air and
the greenness of the leaves daunted him Already on the walk from the station
the May sunshine had made him feel dirty and etiolated a creature of indoors
with the sooty dust of London in the pores of his skin It occurred to him that
till now she had probably never seen him in broad daylight in the open They
came to the fallen tree that she had spoken of The girl hopped over and forced
apart the bushes in which there did not seem to be an opening When Winston
followed her he found that they were in a natural clearing a tiny grassy knoll
surrounded by tall saplings that shut it in completely The girl stopped and
turned
Here we are she said
He was facing her at several paces distance As yet he did not dare move
nearer to her
I didnt want to say anything in the lane she went on in case theres a
mike hidden there I dont suppose there is but there could be Theres always
the chance of one of those swine recognizing your voice Were all right here
He still had not the courage to approach her Were all right here he
repeated stupidly
Yes Look at the trees They were small ashes which at some time had
been cut down and had sprouted up again into a forest of poles none of them
thicker than ones wrist Theres nothing big enough to hide a mike in Besides
Ive been here before
They were only making conversation He had managed to move closer to her
now She stood before him very upright with a smile on her face that looked
faintly ironical as though she were wondering why he was so slow to act The
bluebells had cascaded on to the ground They seemed to have fallen of their
own accord He took her hand
Would you believe he said that till this moment I didnt know what colour
your eyes were They were brown he noted a rather light shade of brown with
dark lashes Now that youve seen what Im really like can you still bear to
look at me
Yes easily
Im thirtynine years old Ive got a wife that I cant get rid of Ive got
varicose veins Ive got ve false teeth
I couldnt care less said the girl
The next moment it was hard to say by whose act she was in his his arms
At the beginning he had no feeling except sheer incredulity The youthful body
was strained against his own the mass of dark hair was against his face and
yes actually she had turned her face up and he was kissing the wide red mouth
She had clasped her arms about his neck she was calling him darling precious
one loved one He had pulled her down on to the ground she was utterly
unresisting he could do what he liked with her But the truth was that he had
no physical sensation except that of mere contact All he felt was incredulity
and pride He was glad that this was happening but he had no physical desire
It was too soon her youth and prettiness had frightened him he was too much

used to living without women  he did not know the reason The girl picked
herself up and pulled a bluebell out of her hair She sat against him putting
her arm round his waist
Never mind dear Theres no hurry Weve got the whole afternoon Isnt
this a splendid hideout I found it when I got lost once on a community hike
If anyone was coming you could hear them a hundred metres away
What is your name said Winston
Julia I know yours Its Winston  Winston Smith
How did you nd that out
I expect Im better at nding things out than you are dear Tell me what
did you think of me before that day I gave you the note
He did not feel any temptation to tell lies to her It was even a sort of
loveoering to start o by telling the worst
I hated the sight of you he said I wanted to rape you and then murder you
afterwards Two weeks ago I thought seriously of smashing your head in with
a cobblestone If you really want to know I imagined that you had something
to do with the Thought Police
The girl laughed delightedly evidently taking this as a tribute to the excel
lence of her disguise
Not the Thought Police You didnt honestly think that
Well perhaps not exactly that But from your general appearance  merely
because youre young and fresh and healthy you understand  I thought that
probably
You thought I was a good Party member Pure in word and deed Banners
processions slogans games community hikes all that stu And you thought
that if I had a quarter of a chance Id denounce you as a thoughtcriminal and
get you killed o
Yes something of that kind A great many young girls are like that you
know
Its this bloody thing that does it she said ripping o the scarlet sash of
the Junior AntiSex League and inging it on to a bough Then as though
touching her waist had reminded her of something she felt in the pocket of her
overalls and produced a small slab of chocolate She broke it in half and gave
one of the pieces to Winston Even before he had taken it he knew by the smell
that it was very unusual chocolate It was dark and shiny and was wrapped in
silver paper Chocolate normally was dullbrown crumbly stu that tasted as
nearly as one could describe it like the smoke of a rubbish re But at some
time or another he had tasted chocolate like the piece she had given him The
rst whi of its scent had stirred up some memory which he could not pin down
but which was powerful and troubling
Where did you get this stu he said
Black market she said indierently Actually I am that sort of girl to
look at Im good at games I was a troopleader in the Spies I do voluntary
work three evenings a week for the Junior AntiSex League Hours and hours
Ive spent pasting their bloody rot all over London I always carry one end of
a banner in the processions I always Iook cheerful and I never shirk anything
Always yell with the crowd thats what I say Its the only way to be safe
The rst fragment of chocolate had melted on Winstons tongue The taste
was delightful But there was still that memory moving round the edges of his
consciousness something strongly felt but not reducible to denite shape like

===== Page 71 =====
an object seen out of the corner of ones eye He pushed it away from him
aware only that it was the memory of some action which he would have liked
to undo but could not
You are very young he said You are ten or fteen years younger than I
am What could you see to attract you in a man like me
It was something in your face I thought Id take a chance Im good at
spotting people who dont belong As soon as I saw you I knew you were against
them
Them it appeared meant the Party and above all the Inner Party about
whom she talked with an open jeering hatred which made Winston feel uneasy
although he knew that they were safe here if they could be safe anywhere
A thing that astonished him about her was the coarseness of her language
Party members were supposed not to swear and Winston himself very seldom
did swear aloud at any rate Julia however seemed unable to mention the
Party and especially the Inner Party without using the kind of words that you
saw chalked up in dripping alleyways He did not dislike it It was merely
one symptom of her revolt against the Party and all its ways and somehow it
seemed natural and healthy like the sneeze of a horse that smells bad hay They
had left the clearing and were wandering again through the chequered shade
with their arms round each others waists whenever it was wide enough to walk
two abreast He noticed how much softer her waist seemed to feel now that the
sash was gone They did not speak above a whisper Outside the clearing Julia
said it was better to go quietly Presently they had reached the edge of the
little wood She stopped him
Dont go out into the open There might be someone watching Were all
right if we keep behind the boughs
They were standing in the shade of hazel bushes The sunlight ltering
through innumerable leaves was still hot on their faces Winston looked out
into the eld beyond and underwent a curious slow shock of recognition He
knew it by sight An old closebitten pasture with a footpath wandering across
it and a molehill here and there In the ragged hedge on the opposite side the
boughs of the elm trees swayed just perceptibly in the breeze and their leaves
stirred faintly in dense masses like womens hair Surely somewhere nearby
but out of sight there must be a stream with green pools where dace were
swimming
Isnt there a stream somewhere near here he whispered
Thats right there is a stream Its at the edge of the next eld actually
There are sh in it great big ones You can watch them lying in the pools under
the willow trees waving their tails
Its the Golden Country  almost he murmured
The Golden Country
Its nothing really A landscape Ive seen sometimes in a dream
Look whispered Julia
A thrush had alighted on a bough not ve metres away almost at the level
of their faces Perhaps it had not seen them It was in the sun they in the
shade It spread out its wings tted them carefully into place again ducked
its head for a moment as though making a sort of obeisance to the sun and
then began to pour forth a torrent of song In the afternoon hush the volume
of sound was startling Winston and Julia clung together fascinated The
music went on and on minute after minute with astonishing variations never

===== Page 72 =====
once repeating itself almost as though the bird were deliberately showing o
its virtuosity Sometimes it stopped for a few seconds spread out and resettled
its wings then swelled its speckled breast and again burst into song Winston
watched it with a sort of vague reverence For whom for what was that bird
singing No mate no rival was watching it What made it sit at the edge of the
lonely wood and pour its music into nothingness He wondered whether after
all there was a microphone hidden somewhere near He and Julia had spoken
only in low whispers and it would not pick up what they had said but it would
pick up the thrush Perhaps at the other end of the instrument some small
beetlelike man was listening intently  listening to that But by degrees the
ood of music drove all speculations out of his mind It was as though it were a
kind of liquid stu that poured all over him and got mixed up with the sunlight
that ltered through the leaves He stopped thinking and merely felt The girls
waist in the bend of his arm was soft and warm He pulled her round so that
they were breast to breast her body seemed to melt into his Wherever his
hands moved it was all as yielding as water Their mouths clung together it
was quite dierent from the hard kisses they had exchanged earlier When they
moved their faces apart again both of them sighed deeply The bird took fright
and ed with a clatter of wings
Winston put his lips against her ear Now he whispered
Not here she whispered back Come back to the hide out Its safer
Quickly with an occasional crackle of twigs they threaded their way back
to the clearing When they were once inside the ring of saplings she turned and
faced him They were both breathing fast but the smile had reappeared round
the corners of her mouth She stood looking at him for an instant then felt
at the zipper of her overalls And yes it was almost as in his dream Almost
as swiftly as he had imagined it she had torn her clothes o and when she
ung them aside it was with that same magnicent gesture by which a whole
civilization seemed to be annihilated Her body gleamed white in the sun But
for a moment he did not look at her body his eyes were anchored by the freckled
face with its faint bold smile He knelt down before her and took her hands in
his
Have you done this before
Of course Hundreds of times  well scores of times anyway With Party
members
Yes always with Party members
With members of the Inner Party
Not with those swine no But theres plenty that would if they got half a
chance Theyre not so holy as they make out
His heart leapt Scores of times she had done it he wished it had been
hundreds  thousands Anything that hinted at corruption always lled him
with a wild hope Who knew perhaps the Party was rotten under the surface
its cult of strenuousness and selfdenial simply a sham concealing iniquity If he
could have infected the whole lot of them with leprosy or syphilis how gladly
he would have done so Anything to rot to weaken to undermine He pulled
her down so that they were kneeling face to face
Listen The more men youve had the more I love you Do you understand
that
Yes perfectly

===== Page 73 =====
I hate purity I hate goodness I dont want any virtue to exist anywhere I
want everyone to be corrupt to the bones
Well then I ought to suit you dear Im corrupt to the bones
You like doing this I dont mean simply me I mean the thing in itself
I adore it
That was above all what he wanted to hear Not merely the love of one
person but the animal instinct the simple undierentiated desire that was
the force that would tear the Party to pieces He pressed her down upon the
grass among the fallen bluebells This time there was no diculty Presently
the rising and falling of their breasts slowed to normal speed and in a sort of
pleasant helplessness they fell apart The sun seemed to have grown hotter
They were both sleepy He reached out for the discarded overalls and pulled
them partly over her Almost immediately they fell asleep and slept for about
half an hour
Winston woke rst He sat up and watched the freckled face still peacefully
asleep pillowed on the palm of her hand Except for her mouth you could not
call her beautiful There was a line or two round the eyes if you looked closely
The short dark hair was extraordinarily thick and soft It occurred to him that
he still did not know her surname or where she lived
The young strong body now helpless in sleep awoke in him a pitying
protecting feeling But the mindless tenderness that he had felt under the hazel
tree while the thrush was singing had not quite come back He pulled the
overalls aside and studied her smooth white ank In the old days he thought
a man looked at a girls body and saw that it was desirable and that was the
end of the story But you could not have pure love or pure lust nowadays No
emotion was pure because everything was mixed up with fear and hatred Their
embrace had been a battle the climax a victory It was a blow struck against
the Party It was a political act

Chapter 
We can come here once again said Julia Its generally safe to use any hideout
twice But not for another month or two of course
As soon as she woke up her demeanour had changed She became alert and
businesslike put her clothes on knotted the scarlet sash about her waist and
began arranging the details of the journey home It seemed natural to leave this
to her She obviously had a practical cunning which Winston lacked and she
seemed also to have an exhaustive knowledge of the countryside round London
stored away from innumerable community hikes The route she gave him was
quite dierent from the one by which he had come and brought him out at a
dierent railway station Never go home the same way as you went out she
said as though enunciating an important general principle She would leave
rst and Winston was to wait half an hour before following her
She had named a place where they could meet after work four evenings
hence It was a street in one of the poorer quarters where there was an open
market which was generally crowded and noisy She would be hanging about
among the stalls pretending to be in search of shoelaces or sewingthread If she
judged that the coast was clear she would blow her nose when he approached
otherwise he was to walk past her without recognition But with luck in the
middle of the crowd it would be safe to talk for a quarter of an hour and arrange
another meeting
And now I must go she said as soon as he had mastered his instructions
Im due back at nineteenthirty Ive got to put in two hours for the Junior
AntiSex League handing out leaets or something Isnt it bloody Give me a
brushdown would you Have I got any twigs in my hair Are you sure Then
goodbye my love goodbye
She ung herself into his arms kissed him almost violently and a moment
later pushed her way through the saplings and disappeared into the wood with
very little noise Even now he had not found out her surname or her address
However it made no dierence for it was inconceivable that they could ever
meet indoors or exchange any kind of written communication
As it happened they never went back to the clearing in the wood During
the month of May there was only one further occasion on which they actually
succeeded in making love That was in another hidlngplace known to Julia
the belfry of a ruinous church in an almostdeserted stretch of country where an
atomic bomb had fallen thirty years earlier It was a good hidingplace when
once you got there but the getting there was very dangerous For the rest
they could meet only in the streets in a dierent place every evening and never

===== Page 75 =====
for more than half an hour at a time In the street it was usually possible to
talk after a fashion As they drifted down the crowded pavements not quite
abreast and never looking at one another they carried on a curious intermittent
conversation which icked on and o like the beams of a lighthouse suddenly
nipped into silence by the approach of a Party uniform or the proximity of a
telescreen then taken up again minutes later in the middle of a sentence then
abruptly cut short as they parted at the agreed spot then continued almost
without introduction on the following day Julia appeared to be quite used to
this kind of conversation which she called talking by instalments She was also
surprisingly adept at speaking without moving her lips Just once in almost a
month of nightly meetings they managed to exchange a kiss They were passing
in silence down a sidestreet Julia would never speak when they were away from
the main streets when there was a deafening roar the earth heaved and the air
darkened and Winston found himself lying on his side bruised and terried A
rocket bomb must have dropped quite near at hand Suddenly he became aware
of Julias face a few centimetres from his own deathly white as white as chalk
Even her lips were white She was dead He clasped her against him and found
that he was kissing a live warm face But there was some powdery stu that
got in the way of his lips Both of their faces were thickly coated with plaster
There were evenings when they reached their rendezvous and then had to
walk past one another without a sign because a patrol had just come round
the corner or a helicopter was hovering overhead Even if it had been less
dangerous it would still have been dicult to nd time to meet Winstons
working week was sixty hours Julias was even longer and their free days varied
according to the pressure of work and did not often coincide Julia in any case
seldom had an evening completely free She spent an astonishing amount of time
in attending lectures and demonstrations distributing literature for the junior
AntiSex League preparing banners for Hate Week making collections for the
savings campaign and suchlike activities It paid she said it was camouage
If you kept the small rules you could break the big ones She even induced
Winston to mortgage yet another of his evenings by enrolling himself for the
parttime munition work which was done voluntarily by zealous Party members
So one evening every week Winston spent four hours of paralysing boredom
screwing together small bits of metal which were probably parts of bomb fuses
in a draughty illlit workshop where the knocking of hammers mingled drearily
with the music of the telescreens
When they met in the church tower the gaps in their fragmentary conver
sation were lled up It was a blazing afternoon The air in the little square
chamber above the bells was hot and stagnant and smelt overpoweringly of
pigeon dung They sat talking for hours on the dusty twiglittered oor one
or other of them getting up from time to time to cast a glance through the
arrowslits and make sure that no one was coming
Julia was twentysix years old She lived in a hostel with thirty other girls
Always in the stink of women How I hate women she said parenthetically
and she worked as he had guessed on the novelwriting machines in the Fiction
Department She enjoyed her work which consisted chiey in running and
servicing a powerful but tricky electric motor She was not clever but was
fond of using her hands and felt at home with machinery She could describe
the whole process of composing a novel from the general directive issued by
the Planning Committee down to the nal touchingup by the Rewrite Squad

===== Page 76 =====
But she was not interested in the nished product She didnt much care for
reading she said Books were just a commodity that had to be produced like
jam or bootlaces
She had no memories of anything before the early sixties and the only person
she had ever known who talked frequently of the days before the Revolution
was a grandfather who had disappeared when she was eight At school she had
been captain of the hockey team and had won the gymnastics trophy two years
running She had been a troopleader in the Spies and a branch secretary in the
Youth League before joining the Junior AntiSex League She had always borne
an excellent character She had even an infallible mark of good reputation
been picked out to work in Pornosec the subsection of the Fiction Department
which turned out cheap pornography for distribution among the proles It was
nicknamed Muck House by the people who worked in it she remarked There
she had remained for a year helping to produce booklets in sealed packets
with titles like Spanking Stories or One Night in a Girls School to be bought
furtively by proletarian youths who were under the impression that they were
buying something illegal
What are these books like said Winston curiously
Oh ghastly rubbish Theyre boring really They only have six plots but
they swap them round a bit Of course I was only on the kaleidoscopes I was
never in the Rewrite Squad Im not literary dear  not even enough for that
He learned with astonishment that all the workers in Pornosec except the
heads of the departments were girls The theory was that men whose sex
instincts were less controllable than those of women were in greater danger of
being corrupted by the lth they handled
They dont even like having married women there she added Girls are
always supposed to be so pure Heres one who isnt anyway
She had had her rst loveaair when she was sixteen with a Party member
of sixty who later committed suicide to avoid arrest And a good job too said
Julia otherwise theyd have had my name out of him when he confessed Since
then there had been various others Life as she saw it was quite simple You
wanted a good time they meaning the Party wanted to stop you having it
you broke the rules as best you couId She seemed to think it just as natural
that they should want to rob you of your pleasures as that you should want
to avoid being caught She hated the Party and said so in the crudest words
but she made no general criticism of it Except where it touched upon her
own life she had no interest in Party doctrine He noticed that she never used
Newspeak words except the ones that had passed into everyday use She had
never heard of the Brotherhood and refused to believe in its existence Any
kind of organized revolt against the Party which was bound to be a failure
struck her as stupid The clever thing was to break the rules and stay alive all
the same He wondered vaguely how many others like her there might be in the
younger generation people who had grown up in the world of the Revolution
knowing nothing else accepting the Party as something unalterable like the
sky not rebelling against its authority but simply evading it as a rabbit dodges
a dog
They did not discuss the possibility of getting married It was too remote to
be worth thinking about No imaginable committee would ever sanction such a
marriage even if Katharine Winstons wife could somehow have been got rid
of It was hopeless even as a daydream

===== Page 77 =====
What was she like your wife said Julia
She was  do you know the Newspeak word goodthinkful Meaning natu
rally orthodox incapable of thinking a bad thought
No I didnt know the word but I know the kind of person right enough
He began telling her the story of his married life but curiously enough she
appeared to know the essential parts of it already She described to him almost
as though she had seen or felt it the stiening of Katharines body as soon as
he touched her the way in which she still seemed to be pushing him from her
with all her strength even when her arms were clasped tightly round him With
Julia he felt no diculty in talking about such things Katharine in any case
had long ceased to be a painful memory and became merely a distasteful one
I could have stood it if it hadnt been for one thing he said He toId her
about the frigid little ceremony that Katharine had forced him to go through
on the same night every week She hated it but nothing would make her stop
doing it She used to call it  but youll never guess
Our duty to the Party said Julia promptly
How did you know that
Ive been at school too dear Sex talks once a month for the oversixteens
And in the Youth Movement They rub it into you for years I dare say it works
in a lot of cases But of course you can never tell people are such hypocrites
She began to enlarge upon the subject With Julia everything came back
to her own sexuality As soon as this was touched upon in any way she was
capable of great acuteness Unlike Winston she had grasped the inner meaning
of the Partys sexual puritanism It was not merely that the sex instinct created
a world of its own which was outside the Partys control and which therefore
had to be destroyed if possible What was more important was that sexual
privation induced hysteria which was desirable because it could be transformed
into warfever and leaderworship The way she put it was
When you make love youre using up energy and afterwards you feel happy
and dont give a damn for anything They cant bear you to feel like that They
want you to be bursting with energy all the time All this marching up and down
and cheering and waving ags is simply sex gone sour If youre happy inside
yourself why should you get excited about Big Brother and the ThreeYear
Plans and the Two Minutes Hate and all the rest of their bloody rot
That was very true he thought There was a direct intimate connexion be
tween chastity and political orthodoxy For how could the fear the hatred and
the lunatic credulity which the Party needed in its members be kept at the right
pitch except by bottling down some powerful instinct and using it as a driving
force The sex impulse was dangerous to the Party and the Party had turned
it to account They had played a similar trick with the instinct of parenthood
The family could not actually be abolished and indeed people were encour
aged to be fond of their children in almost the oldfashioned way The children
on the other hand were systematically turned against their parents and taught
to spy on them and report their deviations The family had become in eect an
extension of the Thought Police It was a device by means of which everyone
could be surrounded night and day by informers who knew him intimately
Abruptly his mind went back to Katharine Katharine would unquestionably
have denounced him to the Thought Police if she had not happened to be too
stupid to detect the unorthodoxy of his opinions But what really recalled
her to him at this moment was the stiing heat of the afternoon which had

===== Page 78 =====
brought the sweat out on his forehead He began telling Julia of something that
had happened or rather had failed to happen on another sweltering summer
afternoon eleven years ago
It was three or four months after they were married They had lost their
way on a community hike somewhere in Kent They had only lagged behind the
others for a couple of minutes but they took a wrong turning and presently
found themselves pulled up short by the edge of an old chalk quarry It was a
sheer drop of ten or twenty metres with boulders at the bottom There was
nobody of whom they could ask the way As soon as she realized that they were
lost Katharine became very uneasy To be away from the noisy mob of hikers
even for a moment gave her a feeling of wrongdoing She wanted to hurry back
by the way they had come and start searching in the other direction But at
this moment Winston noticed some tufts of loosestrife growing in the cracks of
the cli beneath them One tuft was of two colours magenta and brickred
apparently growing on the same root He had never seen anything of the kind
before and he called to Katharine to come and look at it
Look Katharine Look at those owers That clump down near the bottom
Do you see theyre two dierent colours
She had already turned to go but she did rather fretfully come back for a
moment She even leaned out over the cli face to see where he was pointing
He was standing a little behind her and he put his hand on her waist to steady
her At this moment it suddenly occurred to him how completely alone they
were There was not a human creature anywhere not a leaf stirring not even
a bird awake In a place like this the danger that there would be a hidden
microphone was very small and even if there was a microphone it would only
pick up sounds It was the hottest sleepiest hour of the afternoon The sun
blazed down upon them the sweat tickled his face And the thought struck him

Why didnt you give her a good shove said Julia I would have
Yes dear you would have I would if Id been the same person then as I
am now Or perhaps I would  Im not certain
Are you sorry you didnt
Yes On the whole Im sorry I didnt
They were sitting side by side on the dusty oor He pulled her closer against
him Her head rested on his shoulder the pleasant smell of her hair conquering
the pigeon dung She was very young he thought she still expected something
from life she did not understand that to push an inconvenient person over a
cli solves nothing
Actually it would have made no dierence he said
Then why are you sorry you didnt do it
Only because I prefer a positive to a negative In this game that were
playing we cant win Some kinds of failure are better than other kinds thats
all
He felt her shoulders give a wriggle of dissent She always contradicted him
when he said anything of this kind She would not accept it as a law of nature
that the individual is always defeated In a way she realized that she herself was
doomed that sooner or later the Thought Police would catch her and kill her
but with another part of her mind she believed that it was somehow possible to
construct a secret world in which you could live as you chose All you needed
was luck and cunning and boldness She did not understand that there was no

===== Page 79 =====
such thing as happiness that the only victory lay in the far future long after
you were dead that from the moment of declaring war on the Party it was
better to think of yourself as a corpse
We are the dead he said
Were not dead yet said Julia prosaically
Not physically Six months a year  ve years conceivably I am afraid
of death You are young so presumably youre more afraid of it than I am
Obviously we shall put it o as long as we can But it makes very little dierence
So long as human beings stay human death and life are the same thing
Oh rubbish Which would you sooner sleep with me or a skeleton Dont
you enjoy being alive Dont you like feeling This is me this is my hand this
is my leg Im real Im solid Im alive Dont you like this
She twisted herself round and pressed her bosom against him He could feel
her breasts ripe yet rm through her overalls Her body seemed to be pouring
some of its youth and vigour into his
Yes I like that he said
Then stop talking about dying And now listen dear weve got to x up
about the next time we meet We may as well go back to the place in the wood
Weve given it a good long rest But you must get there by a dierent way this
time Ive got it all planned out You take the train  but look Ill draw it out
for you
And in her practical way she scraped together a small square of dust and
with a twig from a pigeons nest began drawing a map on the oor

Winston looked round the shabby little room above Mr Charringtons shop
Beside the window the enormous bed was made up with ragged blankets and
a coverless bolster The oldfashioned clock with the twelvehour face was tick
ing away on the mantelpiece In the corner on the gateleg table the glass
paperweight which he had bought on his last visit gleamed softly out of the
halfdarkness
In the fender was a battered tin oilstove a saucepan and two cups provided
by Mr Charrington Winston lit the burner and set a pan of water to boil He
had brought an envelope full of Victory Coee and some saccharine tablets
The clocks hands said seventeentwenty it was nineteentwenty really She
was coming at nineteenthirty
Folly folly his heart kept saying conscious gratuitous suicidal folly Of all
the crimes that a Party member could commit this one was the least possible
to conceal Actually the idea had rst oated into his head in the form of a
vision of the glass paperweight mirrored by the surface of the gateleg table
As he had foreseen Mr Charrington had made no diculty about letting the
room He was obviously glad of the few dollars that it would bring him Nor
did he seem shocked or become oensively knowing when it was made clear that
Winston wanted the room for the purpose of a loveaair Instead he looked
into the middle distance and spoke in generalities with so delicate an air as
to give the impression that he had become partly invisible Privacy he said
was a very valuable thing Everyone wanted a place where they could be alone
occasionally And when they had such a place it was only common courtesy in
anyone else who knew of it to keep his knowledge to himself He even seeming
almost to fade out of existence as he did so added that there were two entries
to the house one of them through the back yard which gave on an alley
Under the window somebody was singing Winston peeped out secure in
the protection of the muslin curtain The June sun was still high in the sky
and in the sunlled court below a monstrous woman solid as a Norman pillar
with brawny red forearms and a sacking apron strapped about her middle was
stumping to and fro between a washtub and a clothes line pegging out a series of
square white things which Winston recognized as babies diapers Whenever her
mouth was not corked with clothes pegs she was singing in a powerful contralto
It was only an opeless fancy
It passed like an Ipril dye
But a look an a word an the dreams they stirred
They ave stolen my eart awye

The tune had been haunting London for weeks past It was one of countless
similar songs published for the benet of the proles by a subsection of the Music
Department The words of these songs were composed without any human
intervention whatever on an instrument known as a versicator But the woman
sang so tunefully as to turn the dreadful rubbish into an almost pleasant sound
He could hear the woman singing and the scrape of her shoes on the agstones
and the cries of the children in the street and somewhere in the far distance
a faint roar of trac and yet the room seemed curiously silent thanks to the
absence of a telescreen
Folly folly folly he thought again It was inconceivable that they could
frequent this place for more than a few weeks without being caught But the
temptation of having a hidingplace that was truly their own indoors and near
at hand had been too much for both of them For some time after their visit to
the church belfry it had been impossible to arrange meetings Working hours
had been drastically increased in anticipation of Hate Week It was more than
a month distant but the enormous complex preparations that it entailed were
throwing extra work on to everybody Finally both of them managed to secure
a free afternoon on the same day They had agreed to go back to the clearing
in the wood On the evening beforehand they met briey in the street As
usual Winston hardly looked at Julia as they drifted towards one another in
the crowd but from the short glance he gave her it seemed to him that she was
paler than usual
Its all o she murmured as soon as she judged it safe to speak Tomorrow
I mean
What
Tomorrow afternoon I cant come
Why not
Oh the usual reason Its started early this time
For a moment he was violently angry During the month that he had known
her the nature of his desire for her had changed At the beginning there had
been little true sensuality in it Their rst lovemaking had been simply an act
of the will But after the second time it was dierent The smell of her hair the
taste of her mouth the feeling of her skin seemed to have got inside him or into
the air all round him She had become a physical necessity something that he
not only wanted but felt that he had a right to When she said that she could
not come he had the feeling that she was cheating him But just at this moment
the crowd pressed them together and their hands accidentally met She gave the
tips of his ngers a quick squeeze that seemed to invite not desire but aection
It struck him that when one lived with a woman this particular disappointment
must be a normal recurring event and a deep tenderness such as he had not
felt for her before suddenly took hold of him He wished that they were a
married couple of ten years standing He wished that he were walking through
the streets with her just as they were doing now but openly and without fear
talking of trivialities and buying odds and ends for the household He wished
above all that they had some place where they could be alone together without
feeling the obligation to make love every time they met It was not actually at
that moment but at some time on the following day that the idea of renting
Mr Charringtons room had occurred to him When he suggested it to Julia she
had agreed with unexpected readiness Both of them knew that it was lunacy
It was as though they were intentionally stepping nearer to their graves As he

sat waiting on the edge of the bed he thought again of the cellars of the Ministry
of Love It was curious how that predestined horror moved in and out of ones
consciousness There it lay xed in future times preceding death as surely as
 precedes  One could not avoid it but one could perhaps postpone it
and yet instead every now and again by a conscious wilful act one chose to
shorten the interval before it happened
At this moment there was a quick step on the stairs Julia burst into the
room She was carrying a toolbag of coarse brown canvas such as he had
sometimes seen her carrying to and fro at the Ministry He started forward to
take her in his arms but she disengaged herself rather hurriedly partly because
she was still holding the toolbag
Half a second she said Just let me show you what Ive brought Did you
bring some of that lthy Victory Coee I thought you would You can chuck
it away again because we shant be needing it Look here
She fell on her knees threw open the bag and tumbled out some spanners
and a screwdriver that lled the top part of it Underneath were a number of
neat paper packets The rst packet that she passed to Winston had a strange
and yet vaguely familiar feeling It was lled with some kind of heavy sandlike
stu which yielded wherever you touched it
It isnt sugar he said
Real sugar Not saccharine sugar And heres a loaf of bread proper white
bread not our bloody stu  and a little pot of jam And heres a tin of milk
 but look This is the one Im really proud of I had to wrap a bit of sacking
round it because
But she did not need to tell him why she had wrapped it up The smell was
already lling the room a rich hot smell which seemed like an emanation from
his early childhood but which one did occasionally meet with even now blowing
down a passageway before a door slammed or diusing itself mysteriously in
a crowded street snied for an instant and then lost again
Its coee he murmured real coee
Its Inner Party coee Theres a whole kilo here she said
How did you manage to get hold of all these things
Its all Inner Party stu Theres nothing those swine dont have nothing
But of course waiters and servants and people pinch things and  look I got
a little packet of tea as well
Winston had squatted down beside her He tore open a corner of the packet
Its real tea Not blackberry leaves
Theres been a lot of tea about lately Theyve captured India or some
thing she said vaguely But listen dear I want you to turn your back on me
for three minutes Go and sit on the other side of the bed Dont go too near
the window And dont turn round till I tell you
Winston gazed abstractedly through the muslin curtain Down in the yard
the redarmed woman was still marching to and fro between the washtub and
the line She took two more pegs out of her mouth and sang with deep feeling
They sye that time eals all things
They sye you can always forget
But the smiles an the tears acrorss the years
They twist my eartstrings yet
She knew the whole drivelling song by heart it seemed Her voice oated
upward with the sweet summer air very tuneful charged with a sort of happy

melancholy One had the feeling that she would have been perfectly content if
the June evening had been endless and the supply of clothes inexhaustible to
remain there for a thousand years pegging out diapers and singing rubbish It
struck him as a curious fact that he had never heard a member of the Party
singing alone and spontaneously It would even have seemed slightly unortho
dox a dangerous eccentricity like talking to oneself Perhaps it was only when
people were somewhere near the starvation level that they had anything to sing
about
You can turn round now said Julia
He turned round and for a second almost failed to recognize her What
he had actually expected was to see her naked But she was not naked The
transformation that had happened was much more surprising than that She
had painted her face
She must have slipped into some shop in the proletarian quarters and bought
herself a complete set of makeup materials Her lips were deeply reddened her
cheeks rouged her nose powdered there was even a touch of something under
the eyes to make them brighter It was not very skilfully done but Winstons
standards in such matters were not high He had never before seen or imagined
a woman of the Party with cosmetics on her face The improvement in her
appearance was startling With just a few dabs of colour in the right places
she had become not only very much prettier but above all far more feminine
Her short hair and boyish overalls merely added to the eect As he took her
in his arms a wave of synthetic violets ooded his nostrils He remembered the
halfdarkness of a basement kitchen and a womans cavernous mouth It was
the very same scent that she had used but at the moment it did not seem to
matter
Scent too he said
Yes dear scent too And do you know what Im going to do next Im
going to get hold of a real womans frock from somewhere and wear it instead
of these bloody trousers Ill wear silk stockings and highheeled shoes In this
room Im going to be a woman not a Party comrade
They ung their clothes o and climbed into the huge mahogany bed It
was the rst time that he had stripped himself naked in her presence Until now
he had been too much ashamed of his pale and meagre body with the varicose
veins standing out on his calves and the discoloured patch over his ankle There
were no sheets but the blanket they lay on was threadbare and smooth and
the size and springiness of the bed astonished both of them Its sure to be full
of bugs but who cares said Julia One never saw a double bed nowadays
except in the homes of the proles Winston had occasionally slept in one in his
boyhood Julia had never been in one before so far as she could remember
Presently they fell asleep for a little while When Winston woke up the
hands of the clock had crept round to nearly nine He did not stir because
Julia was sleeping with her head in the crook of his arm Most of her makeup
had transferred itself to his own face or the bolster but a light stain of rouge still
brought out the beauty of her cheekbone A yellow ray from the sinking sun fell
across the foot of the bed and lighted up the replace where the water in the
pan was boiling fast Down in the yard the woman had stopped singing but the
faint shouts of children oated in from the street He wondered vaguely whether
in the abolished past it had been a normal experience to lie in bed like this in
the cool of a summer evening a man and a woman with no clothes on making

love when they chose talking of what they chose not feeling any compulsion
to get up simply lying there and listening to peaceful sounds outside Surely
there could never have been a time when that seemed ordinary Julia woke up
rubbed her eyes and raised herself on her elbow to look at the oilstove
Half that waters boiled away she said Ill get up and make some coee
in another moment Weve got an hour What time do they cut the lights o
at your ats
Twentythree thirty
Its twentythree at the hostel But you have to get in earlier than that
because  Hi Get out you lthy brute
She suddenly twisted herself over in the bed seized a shoe from the oor
and sent it hurtling into the corner with a boyish jerk of her arm exactly as
he had seen her ing the dictionary at Goldstein that morning during the Two
Minutes Hate
What was it he said in surprise
A rat I saw him stick his beastly nose out of the wainscoting Theres a
hole down there I gave him a good fright anyway
Rats murmured Winston In this room
Theyre all over the place said Julia indierently as she lay down again
Weve even got them in the kitchen at the hostel Some parts of London are
swarming with them Did you know they attack children Yes they do In
some of these streets a woman darent leave a baby alone for two minutes Its
the great huge brown ones that do it And the nasty thing is that the brutes
always
Dont go on said Winston with his eyes tightly shut
Dearest Youve gone quite pale Whats the matter Do they make you
feel sick
Of all horrors in the world  a rat
She pressed herself against him and wound her limbs round him as though
to reassure him with the warmth of her body He did not reopen his eyes
immediately For several moments he had had the feeling of being back in a
nightmare which had recurred from time to time throughout his life It was
always very much the same He was standing in front of a wall of darkness and
on the other side of it there was something unendurable something too dreadful
to be faced In the dream his deepest feeling was always one of selfdeception
because he did in fact know what was behind the wall of darkness With a
deadly eort like wrenching a piece out of his own brain he could even have
dragged the thing into the open He always woke up without discovering what
it was but somehow it was connected with what Julia had been saying when
he cut her short
Im sorry he said its nothing I dont like rats thats all
Dont worry dear were not going to have the lthy brutes in here Ill stu
the hole with a bit of sacking before we go And next time we come here Ill
bring some plaster and bung it up properly
Already the black instant of panic was halfforgotten Feeling slightly ashamed
of himself he sat up against the bedhead Julia got out of bed pulled on her
overalls and made the coee The smell that rose from the saucepan was so
powerful and exciting that they shut the window lest anybody outside should
notice it and become inquisitive What was even better than the taste of the
coee was the silky texture given to it by the sugar a thing Winston had almost

===== Page 85 =====
forgotten after years of saccharine With one hand in her pocket and a piece of
bread and jam in the other Julia wandered about the room glancing indier
ently at the bookcase pointing out the best way of repairing the gateleg table
plumping herself down in the ragged armchair to see if it was comfortable and
examining the absurd twelvehour clock with a sort of tolerant amusement She
brought the glass paperweight over to the bed to have a look at it in a better
light He took it out of her hand fascinated as always by the soft rainwatery
appearance of the glass
What is it do you think said Julia
I dont think its anythingI mean I dont think it was ever put to any use
Thats what I like about it Its a little chunk of history that theyve forgotten
to alter Its a message from a hundred years ago if one knew how to read it
And that picture over there  she nodded at the engraving on the opposite
wallwould that be a hundred years old
More Two hundred I dare say One cant tell Its impossible to discover
the age of anything nowadays
She went over to look at it Heres where that brute stuck his nose out
she said kicking the wainscoting immediately below the picture What is this
place Ive seen it before somewhere
Its a church or at least it used to be St Clement Danes its name was
The fragment of rhyme that Mr Charrington had taught him came back into
his head and he added halfnostalgically Oranges and lemons say the bells
of St Clements
To his astonishment she capped the line
You owe me three farthings say the bells of St Martins
When will you pay me say the bells of Old Bailey  
I cant remember how it goes on after that But anyway I remember it ends
up Here comes a candle to light you to bed here comes a chopper to chop o
your head
It was like the two halves of a countersign But there must be another line
after the bells of Old Bailey Perhaps it could be dug out of Mr Charringtons
memory if he were suitably prompted
Who taught you that he said
My grandfather He used to say it to me when I was a little girl He was
vaporized when I was eight  at any rate he disappeared I wonder what a
lemon was she added inconsequently Ive seen oranges Theyre a kind of
round yellow fruit with a thick skin
I can remember lemons said Winston They were quite common in the
fties They were so sour that it set your teeth on edge even to smell them
I bet that pictures got bugs behind it said Julia Ill take it down and
give it a good clean some day I suppose its almost time we were leaving I
must start washing this paint o What a bore Ill get the lipstick o your face
afterwards
Winston did not get up for a few minutes more The room was darkening
He turned over towards the light and lay gazing into the glass paperweight The
inexhaustibly interesting thing was not the fragment of coral but the interior
of the glass itself There was such a depth of it and yet it was almost as
transparent as air It was as though the surface of the glass had been the arch
of the sky enclosing a tiny world with its atmosphere complete He had the
feeling that he could get inside it and that in fact he was inside it along with

===== Page 86 =====
the mahogany bed and the gateleg table and the clock and the steel engraving
and the paperweight itself The paperweight was the room he was in and the
coral was Julias life and his own xed in a sort of eternity at the heart of the
crystal

Chapter 
Syme had vanished A morning came and he was missing from work a few
thoughtless people commented on his absence On the next day nobody men
tioned him On the third day Winston went into the vestibule of the Records
Department to look at the noticeboard One of the notices carried a printed
list of the members of the Chess Committee of whom Syme had been one It
looked almost exactly as it had looked before  nothing had been crossed out
 but it was one name shorter It was enough Syme had ceased to exist he
had never existed
The weather was baking hot In the labyrinthine Ministry the windowless
airconditioned rooms kept their normal temperature but outside the pave
ments scorched ones feet and the stench of the Tubes at the rush hours was
a horror The preparations for Hate Week were in full swing and the stas of
all the Ministries were working overtime Processions meetings military pa
rades lectures waxworks displays lm shows telescreen programmes all had
to be organized stands had to be erected egies built slogans coined songs
written rumours circulated photographs faked Julias unit in the Fiction De
partment had been taken o the production of novels and was rushing out a
series of atrocity pamphlets Winston in addition to his regular work spent
long periods every day in going through back les of The Times and altering
and embellishing news items which were to be quoted in speeches Late at
night when crowds of rowdy proles roamed the streets the town had a curi
ously febrile air The rocket bombs crashed oftener than ever and sometimes
in the far distance there were enormous explosions which no one could explain
and about which there were wild rumours
The new tune which was to be the themesong of Hate Week the Hate Song
it was called had already been composed and was being endlessly plugged on
the telescreens It had a savage barking rhythm which could not exactly be
called music but resembled the beating of a drum Roared out by hundreds of
voices to the tramp of marching feet it was terrifying The proles had taken a
fancy to it and in the midnight streets it competed with the stillpopular It
was only a hopeless fancy The Parsons children played it at all hours of the
night and day unbearably on a comb and a piece of toilet paper Winstons
evenings were fuller than ever Squads of volunteers organized by Parsons
were preparing the street for Hate Week stitching banners painting posters
erecting agstas on the roofs and perilously slinging wires across the street for
the reception of streamers Parsons boasted that Victory Mansions alone would
display four hundred metres of bunting He was in his native element and as

===== Page 88 =====
happy as a lark The heat and the manual work had even given him a pretext
for reverting to shorts and an open shirt in the evenings He was everywhere at
once pushing pulling sawing hammering improvising jollying everyone along
with comradely exhortations and giving out from every fold of his body what
seemed an inexhaustible supply of acridsmelling sweat
A new poster had suddenly appeared all over London It had no caption
and represented simply the monstrous gure of a Eurasian soldier three or four
metres high striding forward with expressionless Mongolian face and enormous
boots a submachine gun pointed from his hip From whatever angle you looked
at the poster the muzzle of the gun magnied by the foreshortening seemed
to be pointed straight at you The thing had been plastered on every blank
space on every wall even outnumbering the portraits of Big Brother The
proles normally apathetic about the war were being lashed into one of their
periodical frenzies of patriotism As though to harmonize with the general
mood the rocket bombs had been killing larger numbers of people than usual
One fell on a crowded lm theatre in Stepney burying several hundred victims
among the ruins The whole population of the neighbourhood turned out for a
long trailing funeral which went on for hours and was in eect an indignation
meeting Another bomb fell on a piece of waste ground which was used as a
playground and several dozen children were blown to pieces There were further
angry demonstrations Goldstein was burned in egy hundreds of copies of the
poster of the Eurasian soldier were torn down and added to the ames and
a number of shops were looted in the turmoil then a rumour ew round that
spies were directing the rocket bombs by means of wireless waves and an old
couple who were suspected of being of foreign extraction had their house set on
re and perished of suocation
In the room over Mr Charringtons shop when they could get there Julia
and Winston lay side by side on a stripped bed under the open window naked for
the sake of coolness The rat had never come back but the bugs had multiplied
hideously in the heat It did not seem to matter Dirty or clean the room was
paradise As soon as they arrived they would sprinkle everything with pepper
bought on the black market tear o their clothes and make love with sweating
bodies then fall asleep and wake to nd that the bugs had rallied and were
massing for the counterattack
Four ve six  seven times they met during the month of June Winston
had dropped his habit of drinking gin at all hours He seemed to have lost the
need for it He had grown fatter his varicose ulcer had subsided leaving only a
brown stain on the skin above his ankle his ts of coughing in the early morning
had stopped The process of life had ceased to be intolerable he had no longer
any impulse to make faces at the telescreen or shout curses at the top of his
voice Now that they had a secure hidingplace almost a home it did not even
seem a hardship that they could only meet infrequently and for a couple of hours
at a time What mattered was that the room over the junkshop should exist
To know that it was there inviolate was almost the same as being in it The
room was a world a pocket of the past where extinct animals could walk Mr
Charrington thought Winston was another extinct animal He usually stopped
to talk with Mr Charrington for a few minutes on his way upstairs The old
man seemed seldom or never to go out of doors and on the other hand to
have almost no customers He led a ghostlike existence between the tiny dark
shop and an even tinier back kitchen where he prepared his meals and which

===== Page 89 =====
contained among other things an unbelievably ancient gramophone with an
enormous horn He seemed glad of the opportunity to talk Wandering about
among his worthless stock with his long nose and thick spectacles and his bowed
shoulders in the velvet jacket he had always vaguely the air of being a collector
rather than a tradesman With a sort of faded enthusiasm he would nger this
scrap of rubbish or that  a china bottlestopper the painted lid of a broken
snubox a pinchbeck locket containing a strand of some longdead babys hair
 never asking that Winston should buy it merely that he should admire it To
talk to him was like listening to the tinkling of a wornout musicalbox He had
dragged out from the corners of his memory some more fragments of forgotten
rhymes There was one about four and twenty blackbirds and another about a
cow with a crumpled horn and another about the death of poor Cock Robin It
just occurred to me you might be interested he would say with a deprecating
little laugh whenever he produced a new fragment But he could never recall
more than a few lines of any one rhyme
Both of them knewin a way it was never out of their minds that what
was now happening could not last long There were times when the fact of
impending death seemed as palpable as the bed they lay on and they would
cling together with a sort of despairing sensuality like a damned soul grasping
at his last morsel of pleasure when the clock is within ve minutes of striking
But there were also times when they had the illusion not only of safety but
of permanence So long as they were actually in this room they both felt no
harm could come to them Getting there was dicult and dangerous but the
room itself was sanctuary It was as when Winston had gazed into the heart
of the paperweight with the feeling that it would be possible to get inside that
glassy world and that once inside it time could be arrested Often they gave
themselves up to daydreams of escape Their luck would hold indenitely and
they would carry on their intrigue just like this for the remainder of their
natural lives Or Katharine would die and by subtle manoeuvrings Winston
and Julia would succeed in getting married Or they would commit suicide
together Or they would disappear alter themselves out of recognition learn
to speak with proletarian accents get jobs in a factory and live out their lives
undetected in a backstreet It was all nonsense as they both knew In reality
there was no escape Even the one plan that was practicable suicide they
had no intention of carrying out To hang on from day to day and from week
to week spinning out a present that had no future seemed an unconquerable
instinct just as ones lungs will always draw the next breath so long as there is
air available
Sometimes too they talked of engaging in active rebellion against the Party
but with no notion of how to take the rst step Even if the fabulous Brother
hood was a reality there still remained the diculty of nding ones way into
it He told her of the strange intimacy that existed or seemed to exist between
himself and OBrien and of the impulse he sometimes felt simply to walk into
OBriens presence announce that he was the enemy of the Party and demand
his help Curiously enough this did not strike her as an impossibly rash thing
to do She was used to judging people by their faces and it seemed natural to
her that Winston should believe OBrien to be trustworthy on the strength of a
single ash of the eyes Moreover she took it for granted that everyone or nearly
everyone secretly hated the Party and would break the rules if he thought it
safe to do so But she refused to believe that widespread organized opposition

existed or could exist The tales about Goldstein and his underground army
she said were simply a lot of rubbish which the Party had invented for its own
purposes and which you had to pretend to believe in Times beyond number
at Party rallies and spontaneous demonstrations she had shouted at the top of
her voice for the execution of people whose names she had never heard and in
whose supposed crimes she had not the faintest belief When public trials were
happening she had taken her place in the detachments from the Youth League
who surrounded the courts from morning to night chanting at intervals Death
to the traitors During the Two Minutes Hate she always excelled all others in
shouting insults at Goldstein Yet she had only the dimmest idea of who Gold
stein was and what doctrines he was supposed to represent She had grown up
since the Revolution and was too young to remember the ideological battles of
the fties and sixties Such a thing as an independent political movement was
outside her imagination and in any case the Party was invincible It would
always exist and it would always be the same You could only rebel against it
by secret disobedience or at most by isolated acts of violence such as killing
somebody or blowing something up
In some ways she was far more acute than Winston and far less susceptible
to Party propaganda Once when he happened in some connexion to mention
the war against Eurasia she startled him by saying casually that in her opinion
the war was not happening The rocket bombs which fell daily on London
were probably red by the Government of Oceania itself just to keep people
frightened This was an idea that had literally never occurred to him She
also stirred a sort of envy in him by telling him that during the Two Minutes
Hate her great diculty was to avoid bursting out laughing But she only
questioned the teachings of the Party when they in some way touched upon her
own life Often she was ready to accept the ocial mythology simply because
the dierence between truth and falsehood did not seem important to her She
believed for instance having learnt it at school that the Party had invented
aeroplanes In his own schooldays Winston remembered in the late fties
it was only the helicopter that the Party claimed to have invented a dozen
years later when Julia was at school it was already claiming the aeroplane
one generation more and it would be claiming the steam engine And when
he told her that aeroplanes had been in existence before he was born and long
before the Revolution the fact struck her as totally uninteresting After all
what did it matter who had invented aeroplanes It was rather more of a shock
to him when he discovered from some chance remark that she did not remember
that Oceania four years ago had been at war with Eastasia and at peace with
Eurasia It was true that she regarded the whole war as a sham but apparently
she had not even noticed that the name of the enemy had changed I thought
wed always been at war with Eurasia she said vaguely It frightened him a
little The invention of aeroplanes dated from long before her birth but the
switchover in the war had happened only four years ago well after she was
grown up He argued with her about it for perhaps a quarter of an hour In
the end he succeeded in forcing her memory back until she did dimly recall that
at one time Eastasia and not Eurasia had been the enemy But the issue still
struck her as unimportant Who cares she said impatiently Its always one
bloody war after another and one knows the news is all lies anyway
Sometimes he talked to her of the Records Department and the impudent
forgeries that he committed there Such things did not appear to horrify her

===== Page 91 =====
She did not feel the abyss opening beneath her feet at the thought of lies be
coming truths He told her the story of Jones Aaronson and Rutherford and
the momentous slip of paper which he had once held between his ngers It did
not make much impression on her At rst indeed she failed to grasp the point
of the story
Were they friends of yours she said
No I never knew them They were Inner Party members Besides they
were far older men than I was They belonged to the old days before the
Revolution I barely knew them by sight
Then what was there to worry about People are being killed o all the
time arent they
He tried to make her understand This was an exceptional case It wasnt
just a question of somebody being killed Do you realize that the past starting
from yesterday has been actually abolished If it survives anywhere its in a
few solid objects with no words attached to them like that lump of glass there
Already we know almost literally nothing about the Revolution and the years
before the Revolution Every record has been destroyed or falsied every book
has been rewritten every picture has been repainted every statue and street
and building has been renamed every date has been altered And that process
is continuing day by day and minute by minute History has stopped Nothing
exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right I know of
course that the past is falsied but it would never be possible for me to prove
it even when I did the falsication myself After the thing is done no evidence
ever remains The only evidence is inside my own mind and I dont know with
any certainty that any other human being shares my memories Just in that
one instance in my whole life I did possess actual concrete evidence after the
event  years after it
And what good was that
It was no good because I threw it away a few minutes later But if the
same thing happened today I should keep it
Well I wouldnt said Julia Im quite ready to take risks but only for
something worth while not for bits of old newspaper What could you have
done with it even if you had kept it
Not much perhaps But it was evidence It might have planted a few
doubts here and there supposing that Id dared to show it to anybody I dont
imagine that we can alter anything in our own lifetime But one can imagine
little knots of resistance springing up here and there  small groups of people
banding themselves together and gradually growing and even leaving a few
records behind so that the next generations can carry on where we leave o
Im not interested in the next generation dear Im interested in us
Youre only a rebel from the waist downwards he told her
She thought this brilliantly witty and ung her arms round him in delight
In the ramications of party doctrine she had not the faintest interest
Whenever he began to talk of the principles of Ingsoc doublethink the mu
tability of the past and the denial of objective reality and to use Newspeak
words she became bored and confused and said that she never paid any atten
tion to that kind of thing One knew that it was all rubbish so why let oneself
be worried by it She knew when to cheer and when to boo and that was all
one needed If he persisted in talking of such subjects she had a disconcerting
habit of falling asleep She was one of those people who can go to sleep at

any hour and in any position Talking to her he realized how easy it was to
present an appearance of orthodoxy while having no grasp whatever of what
orthodoxy meant In a way the worldview of the Party imposed itself most
successfully on people incapable of understanding it They could be made to ac
cept the most agrant violations of reality because they never fully grasped the
enormity of what was demanded of them and were not suciently interested
in public events to notice what was happening By lack of understanding they
remained sane They simply swallowed everything and what they swallowed
did them no harm because it left no residue behind just as a grain of corn will
pass undigested through the body of a bird

Chapter 
It had happened at last The expected message had come All his life it seemed
to him he had been waiting for this to happen
He was walking down the long corridor at the Ministry and he was almost
at the spot where Julia had slipped the note into his hand when he became
aware that someone larger than himself was walking just behind him The
person whoever it was gave a small cough evidently as a prelude to speaking
Winston stopped abruptly and turned It was OBrien
At last they were face to face and it seemed that his only impulse was
to run away His heart bounded violently He would have been incapable of
speaking OBrien however had continued forward in the same movement
laying a friendly hand for a moment on Winstons arm so that the two of them
were walking side by side He began speaking with the peculiar grave courtesy
that dierentiated him from the majority of Inner Party members
I had been hoping for an opportunity of talking to you he said I was
reading one of your Newspeak articles in The Times the other day You take a
scholarly interest in Newspeak I believe
Winston had recovered part of his selfpossession Hardly scholarly he said
Im only an amateur Its not my subject I have never had anything to do
with the actual construction of the language
But you write it very elegantly said OBrien That is not only my own
opinion I was talking recently to a friend of yours who is certainly an expert
His name has slipped my memory for the moment
Again Winstons heart stirred painfully It was inconceivable that this was
anything other than a reference to Syme But Syme was not only dead he
was abolished an unperson Any identiable reference to him would have been
mortally dangerous OBriens remark must obviously have been intended as a
signal a codeword By sharing a small act of thoughtcrime he had turned the
two of them into accomplices They had continued to stroll slowly down the
corridor but now OBrien halted With the curious disarming friendliness that
he always managed to put in to the gesture he resettled his spectacles on his
nose Then he went on
What I had really intended to say was that in your article I noticed you
had used two words which have become obsolete But they have only become
so very recently Have you seen the tenth edition of the Newspeak Dictionary
No said Winston I didnt think it had been issued yet We are still using
the ninth in the Records Department
The tenth edition is not due to appear for some months I believe But a

===== Page 94 =====
few advance copies have been circulated I have one myself It might interest
you to look at it perhaps
Very much so said Winston immediately seeing where this tended
Some of the new developments are most ingenious The reduction in the
number of verbs  that is the point that will appeal to you I think Let me
see shall I send a messenger to you with the dictionary But I am afraid I
invariably forget anything of that kind Perhaps you could pick it up at my at
at some time that suited you Wait Let me give you my address
They were standing in front of a telescreen Somewhat absentmindedly
OBrien felt two of his pockets and then produced a small leathercovered note
book and a gold inkpencil Immediately beneath the telescreen in such a po
sition that anyone who was watching at the other end of the instrument could
read what he was writing he scribbled an address tore out the page and handed
it to Winston
I am usually at home in the evenings he said If not my servant will give
you the dictionary
He was gone leaving Winston holding the scrap of paper which this time
there was no need to conceal Nevertheless he carefully memorized what was
written on it and some hours later dropped it into the memory hole along with
a mass of other papers
They had been talking to one another for a couple of minutes at the most
There was only one meaning that the episode could possibly have It had
been contrived as a way of letting Winston know OBriens address This was
necessary because except by direct enquiry it was never possible to discover
where anyone lived There were no directories of any kind If you ever want to
see me this is where I can be found was what OBrien had been saying to him
Perhaps there would even be a message concealed somewhere in the dictionary
But at any rate one thing was certain The conspiracy that he had dreamed of
did exist and he had reached the outer edges of it
He knew that sooner or later he would obey OBriens summons Perhaps
tomorrow perhaps after a long delay  he was not certain What was happen
ing was only the workingout of a process that had started years ago The rst
step had been a secret involuntary thought the second had been the opening
of the diary He had moved from thoughts to words and now from words to
actions The last step was something that would happen in the Ministry of
Love He had accepted it The end was contained in the beginning But it was
frightening or more exactly it was like a foretaste of death like being a little
less alive Even while he was speaking to OBrien when the meaning of the
words had sunk in a chilly shuddering feeling had taken possession of his body
He had the sensation of stepping into the dampness of a grave and it was not
much better because he had always known that the grave was there and waiting
for him

Chapter 
Winston had woken up with his eyes full of tears Julia rolled sleepily against
him murmuring something that might have been Whats the matter
I dreamt he began and stopped short It was too complex to be put into
words There was the dream itself and there was a memory connected with it
that had swum into his mind in the few seconds after waking
He lay back with his eyes shut still sodden in the atmosphere of the dream
It was a vast luminous dream in which his whole life seemed to stretch out
before him like a landscape on a summer evening after rain It had all occurred
inside the glass paperweight but the surface of the glass was the dome of the sky
and inside the dome everything was ooded with clear soft light in which one
could see into interminable distances The dream had also been comprehended
by  indeed in some sense it had consisted in  a gesture of the arm made
by his mother and made again thirty years later by the Jewish woman he had
seen on the news lm trying to shelter the small boy from the bullets before
the helicopter blew them both to pieces
Do you know he said that until this moment I believed I had murdered
my mother
Why did you murder her said Julia almost asleep
I didnt murder her Not physically
In the dream he had remembered his last glimpse of his mother and within
a few moments of waking the cluster of small events surrounding it had all
come back It was a memory that he must have deliberately pushed out of his
consciousness over many years He was not certain of the date but he could
not have been less than ten years old possibly twelve when it had happened
His father had disappeared some time earlier how much earlier he could
not remember He remembered better the rackety uneasy circumstances of the
time the periodical panics about airraids and the sheltering in Tube stations
the piles of rubble everywhere the unintelligible proclamations posted at street
corners the gangs of youths in shirts all the same colour the enormous queues
outside the bakeries the intermittent machinegun re in the distance  above
all the fact that there was never enough to eat He remembered long afternoons
spent with other boys in scrounging round dustbins and rubbish heaps picking
out the ribs of cabbage leaves potato peelings sometimes even scraps of stale
breadcrust from which they carefully scraped away the cinders and also in
waiting for the passing of trucks which travelled over a certain route and were
known to carry cattle feed and which when they jolted over the bad patches
in the road sometimes spilt a few fragments of oilcake

When his father disappeared his mother did not show any surprise or any
violent grief but a sudden change came over her She seemed to have become
completely spiritless It was evident even to Winston that she was waiting for
something that she knew must happen She did everything that was needed 
cooked washed mended made the bed swept the oor dusted the mantelpiece
 always very slowly and with a curious lack of superuous motion like an
artists laygure moving of its own accord Her large shapely body seemed
to relapse naturally into stillness For hours at a time she would sit almost
immobile on the bed nursing his young sister a tiny ailing very silent child of
two or three with a face made simian by thinness Very occasionally she would
take Winston in her arms and press him against her for a long time without
saying anything He was aware in spite of his youthfulness and selshness that
this was somehow connected with the nevermentioned thing that was about to
happen
He remembered the room where they lived a dark closesmelling room that
seemed half lled by a bed with a white counterpane There was a gas ring in
the fender and a shelf where food was kept and on the landing outside there
was a brown earthenware sink common to several rooms He remembered his
mothers statuesque body bending over the gas ring to stir at something in
a saucepan Above all he remembered his continuous hunger and the erce
sordid battles at mealtimes He would ask his mother naggingly over and over
again why there was not more food he would shout and storm at her he even
remembered the tones of his voice which was beginning to break prematurely
and sometimes boomed in a peculiar way or he would attempt a snivelling note
of pathos in his eorts to get more than his share His mother was quite ready
to give him more than his share She took it for granted that he the boy
should have the biggest portion but however much she gave him he invariably
demanded more At every meal she would beseech him not to be selsh and to
remember that his little sister was sick and also needed food but it was no use
He would cry out with rage when she stopped ladling he would try to wrench
the saucepan and spoon out of her hands he would grab bits from his sisters
plate He knew that he was starving the other two but he could not help it
he even felt that he had a right to do it The clamorous hunger in his belly
seemed to justify him Between meals if his mother did not stand guard he
was constantly pilfering at the wretched store of food on the shelf
One day a chocolateration was issued There had been no such issue for
weeks or months past He remembered quite clearly that precious little morsel
of chocolate It was a twoounce slab they still talked about ounces in those
days between the three of them It was obvious that it ought to be divided
into three equal parts Suddenly as though he were listening to somebody else
Winston heard himself demanding in a loud booming voice that he should be
given the whole piece His mother told him not to be greedy There was a
long nagging argument that went round and round with shouts whines tears
remonstrances bargainings His tiny sister clinging to her mother with both
hands exactly like a baby monkey sat looking over her shoulder at him with
large mournful eyes In the end his mother broke o threequarters of the
chocolate and gave it to Winston giving the other quarter to his sister The
little girl took hold of it and looked at it dully perhaps not knowing what it
was Winston stood watching her for a moment Then with a sudden swift
spring he had snatched the piece of chocolate out of his sisters hand and was

===== Page 97 =====
eeing for the door
Winston Winston his mother called after him Come back Give your
sister back her chocolate
He stopped but did not come back His mothers anxious eyes were xed
on his face Even now he was thinking about the thing he did not know what
it was that was on the point of happening His sister conscious of having been
robbed of something had set up a feeble wail His mother drew her arm round
the child and pressed its face against her breast Something in the gesture told
him that his sister was dying He turned and ed down the stairs with the
chocolate growing sticky in his hand
He never saw his mother again After he had devoured the chocolate he felt
somewhat ashamed of himself and hung about in the streets for several hours
until hunger drove him home When he came back his mother had disappeared
This was already becoming normal at that time Nothing was gone from the
room except his mother and his sister They had not taken any clothes not
even his mothers overcoat To this day he did not know with any certainty
that his mother was dead It was perfectly possible that she had merely been
sent to a forcedlabour camp As for his sister she might have been removed
like Winston himself to one of the colonies for homeless children Reclamation
Centres they were called which had grown up as a result of the civil war or
she might have been sent to the labour camp along with his mother or simply
left somewhere or other to die
The dream was still vivid in his mind especially the enveloping protecting
gesture of the arm in which its whole meaning seemed to be contained His
mind went back to another dream of two months ago Exactly as his mother
had sat on the dingy whitequilted bed with the child clinging to her so she had
sat in the sunken ship far underneath him and drowning deeper every minute
but still looking up at him through the darkening water
He told Julia the story of his mothers disappearance Without opening her
eyes she rolled over and settled herself into a more comfortable position
I expect you were a beastly little swine in those days she said indistinctly
All children are swine
Yes But the real point of the story
From her breathing it was evident that she was going o to sleep again He
would have liked to continue talking about his mother He did not suppose
from what he could remember of her that she had been an unusual woman
still less an intelligent one and yet she had possessed a kind of nobility a kind
of purity simply because the standards that she obeyed were private ones Her
feelings were her own and could not be altered from outside It would not have
occurred to her that an action which is ineectual thereby becomes meaningless
If you loved someone you loved him and when you had nothing else to give
you still gave him love When the last of the chocolate was gone his mother
had clasped the child in her arms It was no use it changed nothing it did not
produce more chocolate it did not avert the childs death or her own but it
seemed natural to her to do it The refugee woman in the boat had also covered
the little boy with her arm which was no more use against the bullets than
a sheet of paper The terrible thing that the Party had done was to persuade
you that mere impulses mere feelings were of no account while at the same
time robbing you of all power over the material world When once you were in
the grip of the Party what you felt or did not feel what you did or refrained

===== Page 98 =====
from doing made literally no dierence Whatever happened you vanished and
neither you nor your actions were ever heard of again You were lifted clean out
of the stream of history And yet to the people of only two generations ago this
would not have seemed allimportant because they were not attempting to alter
history They were governed by private loyalties which they did not question
What mattered were individual relationships and a completely helpless gesture
an embrace a tear a word spoken to a dying man could have value in itself
The proles it suddenly occurred to him had remained in this condition They
were not loyal to a party or a country or an idea they were loyal to one another
For the rst time in his life he did not despise the proles or think of them merely
as an inert force which would one day spring to life and regenerate the world
The proles had stayed human They had not become hardened inside They had
held on to the primitive emotions which he himself had to relearn by conscious
eort And in thinking this he remembered without apparent relevance how
a few weeks ago he had seen a severed hand lying on the pavement and had
kicked it into the gutter as though it had been a cabbagestalk
The proles are human beings he said aloud We are not human
Why not said Julia who had woken up again
He thought for a little while Has it ever occurred to you he said that the
best thing for us to do would be simply to walk out of here before its too late
and never see each other again
Yes dear it has occurred to me several times But Im not going to do it
all the same
Weve been lucky he said but it cant last much longer Youre young
You look normal and innocent If you keep clear of people like me you might
stay alive for another fty years
No Ive thought it all out What you do Im going to do And dont be
too downhearted Im rather good at staying alive
We may be together for another six months  a year  theres no knowing
At the end were certain to be apart Do you realize how utterly alone we shall
be When once they get hold of us there will be nothing literally nothing that
either of us can do for the other If I confess theyll shoot you and if I refuse to
confess theyll shoot you just the same Nothing that I can do or say or stop
myself from saying will put o your death for as much as ve minutes Neither
of us will even know whether the other is alive or dead We shall be utterly
without power of any kind The one thing that matters is that we shouldnt
betray one another although even that cant make the slightest dierence
If you mean confessing she said we shall do that right enough Everybody
always confesses You cant help it They torture you
I dont mean confessing Confession is not betrayal What you say or do
doesnt matter only feelings matter If they could make me stop loving you 
that would be the real betrayal
She thought it over They cant do that she said nally Its the one thing
they cant do They can make you say anything  anything  but they cant
make you believe it They cant get inside you
No he said a little more hopefully no thats quite true They cant get
inside you If you can feel that staying human is worth while even when it cant
have any result whatever youve beaten them
He thought of the telescreen with its neversleeping ear They could spy
upon you night and day but if you kept your head you could still outwit them

===== Page 99 =====
With all their cleverness they had never mastered the secret of nding out what
another human being was thinking Perhaps that was less true when you were
actually in their hands One did not know what happened inside the Ministry
of Love but it was possible to guess tortures drugs delicate instruments
that registered your nervous reactions gradual wearingdown by sleeplessness
and solitude and persistent questioning Facts at any rate could not be kept
hidden They could be tracked down by enquiry they could be squeezed out of
you by torture But if the object was not to stay alive but to stay human what
dierence did it ultimately make They could not alter your feelings for that
matter you could not alter them yourself even if you wanted to They could
lay bare in the utmost detail everything that you had done or said or thought
but the inner heart whose workings were mysterious even to yourself remained
impregnable

Chapter 
They had done it they had done it at last
The room they were standing in was longshaped and softly lit The tele
screen was dimmed to a low murmur the richness of the darkblue carpet gave
one the impression of treading on velvet At the far end of the room OBrien
was sitting at a table under a greenshaded lamp with a mass of papers on
either side of him He had not bothered to look up when the servant showed
Julia and Winston in
Winstons heart was thumping so hard that he doubted whether he would
be able to speak They had done it they had done it at last was all he could
think It had been a rash act to come here at all and sheer folly to arrive
together though it was true that they had come by dierent routes and only
met on OBriens doorstep But merely to walk into such a place needed an
eort of the nerve It was only on very rare occasions that one saw inside
the dwellingplaces of the Inner Party or even penetrated into the quarter of
the town where they lived The whole atmosphere of the huge block of ats
the richness and spaciousness of everything the unfamiliar smells of good food
and good tobacco the silent and incredibly rapid lifts sliding up and down
the whitejacketed servants hurrying to and fro  everything was intimidating
Although he had a good pretext for coming here he was haunted at every step
by the fear that a blackuniformed guard would suddenly appear from round
the corner demand his papers and order him to get out OBriens servant
however had admitted the two of them without demur He was a small dark
haired man in a white jacket with a diamondshaped completely expressionless
face which might have been that of a Chinese The passage down which he led
them was softly carpeted with creampapered walls and white wainscoting all
exquisitely clean That too was intimidating Winston could not remember
ever to have seen a passageway whose walls were not grimy from the contact of
human bodies
OBrien had a slip of paper between his ngers and seemed to be studying
it intently His heavy face bent down so that one could see the line of the
nose looked both formidable and intelligent For perhaps twenty seconds he sat
without stirring Then he pulled the speakwrite towards him and rapped out a
message in the hybrid jargon of the Ministries
Items one comma ve comma seven approved fullwise stop suggestion con
tained item six doubleplus ridiculous verging crimethink cancel stop unproceed
constructionwise antegetting plusfull estimates machinery overheads stop end
message

He rose deliberately from his chair and came towards them across the sound
less carpet A little of the ocial atmosphere seemed to have fallen away from
him with the Newspeak words but his expression was grimmer than usual as
though he were not pleased at being disturbed The terror that Winston al
ready felt was suddenly shot through by a streak of ordinary embarrassment
It seemed to him quite possible that he had simply made a stupid mistake For
what evidence had he in reality that OBrien was any kind of political conspir
ator Nothing but a ash of the eyes and a single equivocal remark beyond
that only his own secret imaginings founded on a dream He could not even
fall back on the pretence that he had come to borrow the dictionary because
in that case Julias presence was impossible to explain As OBrien passed the
telescreen a thought seemed to strike him He stopped turned aside and pressed
a switch on the wall There was a sharp snap The voice had stopped
Julia uttered a tiny sound a sort of squeak of surprise Even in the midst
of his panic Winston was too much taken aback to be able to hold his tongue
You can turn it o he said
Yes said OBrien we can turn it o We have that privilege
He was opposite them now His solid form towered over the pair of them
and the expression on his face was still indecipherable He was waiting some
what sternly for Winston to speak but about what Even now it was quite
conceivable that he was simply a busy man wondering irritably why he had
been interrupted Nobody spoke After the stopping of the telescreen the room
seemed deadly silent The seconds marched past enormous With diculty
Winston continued to keep his eyes xed on OBriens Then suddenly the grim
face broke down into what might have been the beginnings of a smile With his
characteristic gesture OBrien resettled his spectacles on his nose
Shall I say it or will you he said
I will say it said Winston promptly That thing is really turned o
Yes everything is turned o We are alone
We have come here because
He paused realizing for the rst time the vagueness of his own motives
Since he did not in fact know what kind of help he expected from OBrien it
was not easy to say why he had come here He went on conscious that what
he was saying must sound both feeble and pretentious
We believe that there is some kind of conspiracy some kind of secret orga
nization working against the Party and that you are involved in it We want
to join it and work for it We are enemies of the Party We disbelieve in the
principles of Ingsoc We are thoughtcriminals We are also adulterers I tell
you this because we want to put ourselves at your mercy If you want us to
incriminate ourselves in any other way we are ready
He stopped and glanced over his shoulder with the feeling that the door
had opened Sure enough the little yellowfaced servant had come in without
knocking Winston saw that he was carrying a tray with a decanter and glasses
Martin is one of us said OBrien impassively Bring the drinks over here
Martin Put them on the round table Have we enough chairs Then we may
as well sit down and talk in comfort Bring a chair for yourself Martin This is
business You can stop being a servant for the next ten minutes
The little man sat down quite at his ease and yet still with a servantlike
air the air of a valet enjoying a privilege Winston regarded him out of the
corner of his eye It struck him that the mans whole life was playing a part

===== Page 102 =====
and that he felt it to be dangerous to drop his assumed personality even for a
moment OBrien took the decanter by the neck and lled up the glasses with
a darkred liquid It aroused in Winston dim memories of something seen long
ago on a wall or a hoarding  a vast bottle composed of electric lights which
seemed to move up and down and pour its contents into a glass Seen from the
top the stu looked almost black but in the decanter it gleamed like a ruby It
had a soursweet smell He saw Julia pick up her glass and sni at it with frank
curiosity
It is called wine said OBrien with a faint smile You will have read about
it in books no doubt Not much of it gets to the Outer Party I am afraid
His face grew solemn again and he raised his glass I think it is tting that we
should begin by drinking a health To our Leader To Emmanuel Goldstein
Winston took up his glass with a certain eagerness Wine was a thing he
had read and dreamed about Like the glass paperweight or Mr Charringtons
halfremembered rhymes it belonged to the vanished romantic past the olden
time as he liked to call it in his secret thoughts For some reason he had always
thought of wine as having an intensely sweet taste like that of blackberry jam
and an immediate intoxicating eect Actually when he came to swallow it the
stu was distinctly disappointing The truth was that after years of gindrinking
he could barely taste it He set down the empty glass
Then there is such a person as Goldstein he said
Yes there is such a person and he is alive Where I do not know
And the conspiracy  the organization Is it real It is not simply an
invention of the Thought Police
No it is real The Brotherhood we call it You will never learn much more
about the Brotherhood than that it exists and that you belong to it I will
come back to that presently He looked at his wristwatch It is unwise even
for members of the Inner Party to turn o the telescreen for more than half an
hour You ought not to have come here together and you will have to leave
separately You comrade  he bowed his head to Julia  will leave rst We
have about twenty minutes at our disposal You will understand that I must
start by asking you certain questions In general terms what are you prepared
to do
Anything that we are capable of said Winston
OBrien had turned himself a little in his chair so that he was facing Winston
He almost ignored Julia seeming to take it for granted that Winston could speak
for her For a moment the lids itted down over his eyes He began asking his
questions in a low expressionless voice as though this were a routine a sort of
catechism most of whose answers were known to him already
You are prepared to give your lives
Yes
You are prepared to commit murder
Yes
To commit acts of sabotage which may cause the death of hundreds of
innocent people
Yes
To betray your country to foreign powers
Yes
You are prepared to cheat to forge to blackmail to corrupt the minds of
children to distribute habitforming drugs to encourage prostitution to dissem

inate venereal diseases  to do anything which is likely to cause demoralization
and weaken the power of the Party
Yes
If for example it would somehow serve our interests to throw sulphuric
acid in a childs face  are you prepared to do that
Yes
You are prepared to lose your identity and live out the rest of your life as a
waiter or a dockworker
Yes
You are prepared to commit suicide if and when we order you to do so
Yes
You are prepared the two of you to separate and never see one another
again
No broke in Julia
It appeared to Winston that a long time passed before he answered For
a moment he seemed even to have been deprived of the power of speech His
tongue worked soundlessly forming the opening syllables rst of one word then
of the other over and over again Until he had said it he did not know which
word he was going to say No he said nally
You did well to tell me said OBrien It is necessary for us to know
everything
He turned himself toward Julia and added in a voice with somewhat more
expression in it
Do you understand that even if he survives it may be as a dierent person
We may be obliged to give him a new identity His face his movements the
shape of his hands the colour of his hair  even his voice would be dierent
And you yourself might have become a dierent person Our surgeons can
alter people beyond recognition Sometimes it is necessary Sometimes we even
amputate a limb
Winston could not help snatching another sidelong glance at Martins Mon
golian face There were no scars that he could see Julia had turned a shade
paler so that her freckles were showing but she faced OBrien boldly She
murmured something that seemed to be assent
Good Then that is settled
There was a silver box of cigarettes on the table With a rather absent
minded air OBrien pushed them towards the others took one himself then
stood up and began to pace slowly to and fro as though he could think better
standing They were very good cigarettes very thick and wellpacked with an
unfamiliar silkiness in the paper OBrien looked at his wristwatch again
You had better go back to your Pantry Martin he said I shall switch on
in a quarter of an hour Take a good look at these comrades faces before you
go You will be seeing them again I may not
Exactly as they had done at the front door the little mans dark eyes ickered
over their faces There was not a trace of friendliness in his manner He was
memorizing their appearance but he felt no interest in them or appeared to
feel none It occurred to Winston that a synthetic face was perhaps incapable
of changing its expression Without speaking or giving any kind of salutation
Martin went out closing the door silently behind him OBrien was strolling up
and down one hand in the pocket of his black overalls the other holding his
cigarette

===== Page 104 =====
You understand he said that you will be ghting in the dark You will
always be in the dark You will receive orders and you will obey them without
knowing why Later I shall send you a book from which you will learn the true
nature of the society we live in and the strategy by which we shall destroy it
When you have read the book you will be full members of the Brotherhood
But between the general aims that we are ghting for and the immediate tasks
of the moment you will never know anything I tell you that the Brotherhood
exists but I cannot tell you whether it numbers a hundred members or ten
million From your personal knowledge you will never be able to say that it
numbers even as many as a dozen You will have three or four contacts who
will be renewed from time to time as they disappear As this was your rst
contact it will be preserved When you receive orders they will come from
me If we nd it necessary to communicate with you it will be through Martin
When you are nally caught you will confess That is unavoidable But you
will have very little to confess other than your own actions You will not be
able to betray more than a handful of unimportant people Probably you will
not even betray me By that time I may be dead or I shall have become a
dierent person with a dierent face
He continued to move to and fro over the soft carpet In spite of the bulkiness
of his body there was a remarkable grace in his movements It came out even
in the gesture with which he thrust a hand into his pocket or manipulated a
cigarette More even than of strength he gave an impression of condence and
of an understanding tinged by irony However much in earnest he might be he
had nothing of the singlemindedness that belongs to a fanatic When he spoke
of murder suicide venereal disease amputated limbs and altered faces it was
with a faint air of persiage This is unavoidable his voice seemed to say
this is what we have got to do uninchingly But this is not what we shall be
doing when life is worth living again A wave of admiration almost of worship
owed out from Winston towards OBrien For the moment he had forgotten the
shadowy gure of Goldstein When you looked at OBriens powerful shoulders
and his bluntfeatured face so ugly and yet so civilized it was impossible to
believe that he could be defeated There was no stratagem that he was not equal
to no danger that he could not foresee Even Julia seemed to be impressed
She had let her cigarette go out and was listening intently OBrien went on
You will have heard rumours of the existence of the Brotherhood No doubt
you have formed your own picture of it You have imagined probably a huge
underworld of conspirators meeting secretly in cellars scribbling messages on
walls recognizing one another by codewords or by special movements of the
hand Nothing of the kind exists The members of the Brotherhood have no
way of recognizing one another and it is impossible for any one member to
be aware of the identity of more than a few others Goldstein himself if he
fell into the hands of the Thought Police could not give them a complete list
of members or any information that would lead them to a complete list No
such list exists The Brotherhood cannot be wiped out because it is not an
organization in the ordinary sense Nothing holds it together except an idea
which is indestructible You will never have anything to sustain you except the
idea You will get no comradeship and no encouragement When nally you
are caught you will get no help We never help our members At most when
it is absolutely necessary that someone should be silenced we are occasionally
able to smuggle a razor blade into a prisoners cell You will have to get used

===== Page 105 =====
to living without results and without hope You will work for a while you will
be caught you will confess and then you will die Those are the only results
that you will ever see There is no possibility that any perceptible change will
happen within our own lifetime We are the dead Our only true life is in the
future We shall take part in it as handfuls of dust and splinters of bone But
how far away that future may be there is no knowing It might be a thousand
years At present nothing is possible except to extend the area of sanity little by
little We cannot act collectively We can only spread our knowledge outwards
from individual to individual generation after generation In the face of the
Thought Police there is no other way
He halted and looked for the third time at his wristwatch
It is almost time for you to leave comrade he said to Julia Wait The
decanter is still half full
He lled the glasses and raised his own glass by the stem
What shall it be this time he said still with the same faint suggestion of
irony To the confusion of the Thought Police To the death of Big Brother
To humanity To the future
To the past said Winston
The past is more important agreed OBrien gravely
They emptied their glasses and a moment later Julia stood up to go OBrien
took a small box from the top of a cabinet and handed her a at white tablet
which he told her to place on her tongue It was important he said not to go
out smelling of wine the lift attendants were very observant As soon as the
door had shut behind her he appeared to forget her existence He took another
pace or two up and down then stopped
There are details to be settled he said I assume that you have a hiding
place of some kind
Winston explained about the room over Mr Charringtons shop
That will do for the moment Later we will arrange something else for you
It is important to change ones hidingplace frequently Meanwhile I shall send
you a copy of the book  even OBrien Winston noticed seemed to pronounce
the words as though they were in italics Goldsteins book you understand as
soon as possible It may be some days before I can get hold of one There
are not many in existence as you can imagine The Thought Police hunt them
down and destroy them almost as fast as we can produce them It makes very
little dierence The book is indestructible If the last copy were gone we could
reproduce it almost word for word Do you carry a briefcase to work with you
he added
As a rule yes
What is it like
Black very shabby With two straps
Black two straps very shabby  good One day in the fairly near future
I cannot give a date  one of the messages among your mornings work will
contain a misprinted word and you will have to ask for a repeat On the
following day you will go to work without your briefcase At some time during
the day in the street a man will touch you on the arm and say I think you have
dropped your briefcase The one he gives you will contain a copy of Goldsteins
book You will return it within fourteen days
They were silent for a moment

===== Page 106 =====
There are a couple of minutes before you need go said OBrien We shall
meet again  if we do meet again
Winston looked up at him In the place where there is no darkness he
said hesitantly
OBrien nodded without appearance of surprise In the place where there
is no darkness he said as though he had recognized the allusion And in
the meantime is there anything that you wish to say before you leave Any
message Any question
Winston thought There did not seem to be any further question that he
wanted to ask still less did he feel any impulse to utter highsounding general
ities Instead of anything directly connected with OBrien or the Brotherhood
there came into his mind a sort of composite picture of the dark bedroom where
his mother had spent her last days and the little room over Mr Charringtons
shop and the glass paperweight and the steel engraving in its rosewood frame
Almost at random he said
Did you ever happen to hear an old rhyme that begins Oranges and lemons
say the bells of St Clements
Again OBrien nodded With a sort of grave courtesy he completed the
stanza
Oranges and lemons say the bells of St Clements
You owe me three farthings say the bells of St Martins
When will you pay me say the bells of Old Bailey
When I grow rich say the bells of Shoreditch
You knew the last line said Winston
Yes I knew the last line And now I am afraid it is time for you to go
But wait You had better let me give you one of these tablets
As Winston stood up OBrien held out a hand His powerful grip crushed
the bones of Winstons palm At the door Winston looked back but OBrien
seemed already to be in process of putting him out of mind He was waiting
with his hand on the switch that controlled the telescreen Beyond him Winston
could see the writingtable with its green shaded lamp and the speakwrite and
the wire baskets deepladen with papers The incident was closed Within
thirty seconds it occurred to him OBrien would be back at his interrupted
and important work on behalf of the Party

Chapter 
Winston was gelatinous with fatigue Gelatinous was the right word It had
come into his head spontaneously His body seemed to have not only the weak
ness of a jelly but its translucency He felt that if he held up his hand he would
be able to see the light through it All the blood and lymph had been drained
out of him by an enormous debauch of work leaving only a frail structure of
nerves bones and skin All sensations seemed to be magnied His overalls
fretted his shoulders the pavement tickled his feet even the opening and closing
of a hand was an eort that made his joints creak
He had worked more than ninety hours in ve days So had everyone else in
the Ministry Now it was all over and he had literally nothing to do no Party
work of any description until tomorrow morning He could spend six hours in
the hidingplace and another nine in his own bed Slowly in mild afternoon
sunshine he walked up a dingy street in the direction of Mr Charringtons
shop keeping one eye open for the patrols but irrationally convinced that this
afternoon there was no danger of anyone interfering with him The heavy brief
case that he was carrying bumped against his knee at each step sending a
tingling sensation up and down the skin of his leg Inside it was the book
which he had now had in his possession for six days and had not yet opened
nor even looked at
On the sixth day of Hate Week after the processions the speeches the
shouting the singing the banners the posters the lms the waxworks the
rolling of drums and squealing of trumpets the tramp of marching feet the
grinding of the caterpillars of tanks the roar of massed planes the booming
of guns  after six days of this when the great orgasm was quivering to its
climax and the general hatred of Eurasia had boiled up into such delirium that
if the crowd could have got their hands on the  Eurasian warcriminals
who were to be publicly hanged on the last day of the proceedings they would
unquestionably have torn them to pieces  at just this moment it had been
announced that Oceania was not after all at war with Eurasia Oceania was at
war with Eastasia Eurasia was an ally
There was of course no admission that any change had taken place Merely
it became known with extreme suddenness and everywhere at once that Easta
sia and not Eurasia was the enemy Winston was taking part in a demonstration
in one of the central London squares at the moment when it happened It was
night and the white faces and the scarlet banners were luridly oodlit The
square was packed with several thousand people including a block of about a
thousand schoolchildren in the uniform of the Spies On a scarletdraped plat

form an orator of the Inner Party a small lean man with disproportionately
long arms and a large bald skull over which a few lank locks straggled was
haranguing the crowd A little Rumpelstiltskin gure contorted with hatred
he gripped the neck of the microphone with one hand while the other enormous
at the end of a bony arm clawed the air menacingly above his head His voice
made metallic by the ampliers boomed forth an endless catalogue of atroci
ties massacres deportations lootings rapings torture of prisoners bombing of
civilians lying propaganda unjust aggressions broken treaties It was almost
impossible to listen to him without being rst convinced and then maddened
At every few moments the fury of the crowd boiled over and the voice of the
speaker was drowned by a wild beastlike roaring that rose uncontrollably from
thousands of throats The most savage yells of all came from the schoolchildren
The speech had been proceeding for perhaps twenty minutes when a messenger
hurried on to the platform and a scrap of paper was slipped into the speakers
hand He unrolled and read it without pausing in his speech Nothing altered
in his voice or manner or in the content of what he was saying but suddenly
the names were dierent Without words said a wave of understanding rippled
through the crowd Oceania was at war with Eastasia The next moment there
was a tremendous commotion The banners and posters with which the square
was decorated were all wrong Quite half of them had the wrong faces on them
It was sabotage The agents of Goldstein had been at work There was a riotous
interlude while posters were ripped from the walls banners torn to shreds and
trampled underfoot The Spies performed prodigies of activity in clambering
over the rooftops and cutting the streamers that uttered from the chimneys
But within two or three minutes it was all over The orator still gripping the
neck of the microphone his shoulders hunched forward his free hand clawing at
the air had gone straight on with his speech One minute more and the feral
roars of rage were again bursting from the crowd The Hate continued exactly
as before except that the target had been changed
The thing that impressed Winston in looking back was that the speaker had
switched from one line to the other actually in midsentence not only without a
pause but without even breaking the syntax But at the moment he had other
things to preoccupy him It was during the moment of disorder while the posters
were being torn down that a man whose face he did not see had tapped him
on the shoulder and said Excuse me I think youve dropped your briefcase
He took the briefcase abstractedly without speaking He knew that it would
be days before he had an opportunity to look inside it The instant that the
demonstration was over he went straight to the Ministry of Truth though the
time was now nearly twentythree hours The entire sta of the Ministry had
done likewise The orders already issuing from the telescreen recalling them to
their posts were hardly necessary
Oceania was at war with Eastasia Oceania had always been at war with
Eastasia A large part of the political literature of ve years was now com
pletely obsolete Reports and records of all kinds newspapers books pam
phlets lms soundtracks photographs  all had to be rectied at lightning
speed Although no directive was ever issued it was known that the chiefs of the
Department intended that within one week no reference to the war with Eura
sia or the alliance with Eastasia should remain in existence anywhere The
work was overwhelming all the more so because the processes that it involved
could not be called by their true names Everyone in the Records Department

worked eighteen hours in the twentyfour with two threehour snatches of sleep
Mattresses were brought up from the cellars and pitched all over the corridors
meals consisted of sandwiches and Victory Coee wheeled round on trolleys by
attendants from the canteen Each time that Winston broke o for one of his
spells of sleep he tried to leave his desk clear of work and each time that he
crawled back stickyeyed and aching it was to nd that another shower of paper
cylinders had covered the desk like a snowdrift halfburying the speakwrite and
overowing on to the oor so that the rst job was always to stack them into
a neat enough pile to give him room to work What was worst of all was that
the work was by no means purely mechanical Often it was enough merely to
substitute one name for another but any detailed report of events demanded
care and imagination Even the geographical knowledge that one needed in
transferring the war from one part of the world to another was considerable
By the third day his eyes ached unbearably and his spectacles needed wiping
every few minutes It was like struggling with some crushing physical task
something which one had the right to refuse and which one was nevertheless
neurotically anxious to accomplish In so far as he had time to remember it he
was not troubled by the fact that every word he murmured into the speakwrite
every stroke of his inkpencil was a deliberate lie He was as anxious as anyone
else in the Department that the forgery should be perfect On the morning
of the sixth day the dribble of cylinders slowed down For as much as half
an hour nothing came out of the tube then one more cylinder then nothing
Everywhere at about the same time the work was easing o A deep and as
it were secret sigh went through the Department A mighty deed which could
never be mentioned had been achieved It was now impossible for any human
being to prove by documentary evidence that the war with Eurasia had ever
happened At twelve hundred it was unexpectedly announced that all workers
in the Ministry were free till tomorrow morning Winston still carrying the
briefcase containing the book which had remained between his feet while he
worked and under his body while he slept went home shaved himself and
almost fell asleep in his bath although the water was barely more than tepid
With a sort of voluptuous creaking in his joints he climbed the stair above
Mr Charringtons shop He was tired but not sleepy any longer He opened
the window lit the dirty little oilstove and put on a pan of water for coee
Julia would arrive presently meanwhile there was the book He sat down in
the sluttish armchair and undid the straps of the briefcase
A heavy black volume amateurishly bound with no name or title on the
cover The print also looked slightly irregular The pages were worn at the
edges and fell apart easily as though the book had passed through many
hands The inscription on the titlepage ran

dierent names and their relative numbers as well as their attitude towards
one another have varied from age to age but the essential structure of society
has never altered Even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable
changes the same pattern has always reasserted itself just as a gyroscope will
always return to equilibrium however far it is pushed one way or the other
The aims of these groups are entirely irreconcilable
Winston stopped reading chiey in order to appreciate the fact that he
was reading in comfort and safety He was alone no telescreen no ear at the
keyhole no nervous impulse to glance over his shoulder or cover the page with
his hand The sweet summer air played against his cheek From somewhere far
away there oated the faint shouts of children in the room itself there was no
sound except the insect voice of the clock He settled deeper into the armchair
and put his feet up on the fender It was bliss it was etemity Suddenly as one
sometimes does with a book of which one knows that one will ultimately read
and reread every word he opened it at a dierent place and found himself at

Chapter III
War is Peace
The splitting up of the world into three great superstates was an event
which could be and indeed was foreseen before the middle of the twentieth
century With the absorption of Europe by Russia and of the British Empire by
the United States two of the three existing powers Eurasia and Oceania were
already eectively in being The third Eastasia only emerged as a distinct
unit after another decade of confused ghting The frontiers between the three
superstates are in some places arbitrary and in others they uctuate according
to the fortunes of war but in general they follow geographical lines Eurasia
comprises the whole of the northern part of the European and Asiatic land
mass from Portugal to the Bering Strait Oceania comprises the Americas the
Atlantic islands including the British Isles Australasia and the southern portion
of Africa Eastasia smaller than the others and with a less denite western
frontier comprises China and the countries to the south of it the Japanese
islands and a large but uctuating portion of Manchuria Mongolia and Tibet
In one combination or another these three superstates are permanently
at war and have been so for the past twentyve years War however is
no longer the desperate annihilating struggle that it was in the early decades
of the twentieth centary It is a warfare of limited aims between combatants
who are unable to destroy one another have no material cause for ghting and
are not divided by any genuine ideological dierence This is not to say that
either the conduct of war or the prevailing attitude towards it has become less
bloodthirsty or more chivalrous On the contrary war hysteria is continuous
and universal in all countries and such acts as raping looting the slaughter
of children the reduction of whole populations to slavery and reprisals against
prisoners which extend even to boiling and burying alive are looked upon as
normal and when they are committed by ones own side and not by the enemy
meritorious But in a physical sense war involves very small numbers of people
mostly highlytrained specialists and causes comparatively few casualties The
ghting when there is any takes place on the vague frontiers whose whereabouts
the average man can only guess at or round the Floating Fortresses which
guard strategic spots on the sea lanes In the centres of civilization war means
no more than a continuous shortage of consumption goods and the occasional

crash of a rocket bomb which may cause a few scores of deaths War has in fact
changed its character More exactly the reasons for which war is waged have
changed in their order of importance Motives which were already present to
some small extent in the great wars of the early twentieth centuary have now
become dominant and are consciously recognized and acted upon
To understand the nature of the present war  for in spite of the regrouping
which occurs every few years it is always the same war  one must realize in
the rst place that it is impossible for it to be decisive None of the three super
states could be denitively conquered even by the other two in combination
They are too evenly matched and their natural defences are too formidable
Eurasia is protected by its vast land spaces Oceania by the width of the At
lantic and the Pacic Eastasia by the fecundity and industriousness of its in
habitants Secondly there is no longer in a material sense anything to ght
about With the establishment of selfcontained economies in which production
and consumption are geared to one another the scramble for markets which was
a main cause of previous wars has come to an end while the competition for raw
materials is no longer a matter of life and death In any case each of the three
superstates is so vast that it can obtain almost all the materials that it needs
within its own boundaries In so far as the war has a direct economic purpose
it is a war for labour power Between the frontiers of the superstates and not
permanently in the possession of any of them there lies a rough quadrilateral
with its corners at Tangier Brazzaville Darwin and Hong Kong containing
within it about a fth of the population of the earth It is for the possession
of these thicklypopulated regions and of the northern icecap that the three
powers are constantly struggling In practice no one power ever controls the
whole of the disputed area Portions of it are constantly changing hands and
it is the chance of seizing this or that fragment by a sudden stroke of treachery
that dictates the endless changes of alignment
All of the disputed territories contain valuable minerals and some of them
yield important vegetable products such as rubber which in colder climates it
is necessary to synthesize by comparatively expensive methods But above all
they contain a bottomless reserve of cheap labour Whichever power controls
equatorial Africa or the countries of the Middle East or Southern India or
the Indonesian Archipelago disposes also of the bodies of scores or hundreds
of millions of illpaid and hardworking coolies The inhabitants of these ar
eas reduced more or less openly to the status of slaves pass continually from
conqueror to conqueror and are expended like so much coal or oil in the race
to turn out more armaments to capture more territory to control more labour
power to turn out more armaments to capture more territory and so on inde
nitely It should be noted that the ghting never really moves beyond the edges
of the disputed areas The frontiers of Eurasia ow back and forth between the
basin of the Congo and the northern shore of the Mediterranean the islands of
the Indian Ocean and the Pacic are constantly being captured and recaptured
by Oceania or by Eastasia in Mongolia the dividing line between Eurasia and
Eastasia is never stable round the Pole all three powers lay claim to enormous
territories which in fact are largely unihabited and unexplored but the bal
ance of power always remains roughly even and the territory which forms the
heartland of each superstate always remains inviolate Moreover the labour of
the exploited peoples round the Equator is not really necessary to the worlds
economy They add nothing to the wealth of the world since whatever they

===== Page 112 =====
produce is used for purposes of war and the object of waging a war is always
to be in a better position in which to wage another war By their labour the
slave populations allow the tempo of continuous warfare to be speeded up But
if they did not exist the structure of world society and the process by which it
maintains itself would not be essentially dierent
The primary aim of modern warfare in accordance with the principles of
doublethink this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the
directing brains of the Inner Party is to use up the products of the machine
without raising the general standard of living Ever since the end of the nine
teenth century the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods
has been latent in industrial society At present when few human beings even
have enough to eat this problem is obviously not urgent and it might not have
become so even if no articial processes of destruction had been at work The
world of today is a bare hungry dilapidated place compared with the world that
existed before  and still more so if compared with the imaginary future to
which the people of that period looked forward In the early twentieth century
the vision of a future society unbelievably rich leisured orderly and ecient
 a glittering antiseptic world of glass and steel and snowwhite concrete 
was part of the consciousness of nearly every literate person Science and tech
nology were developing at a prodigious speed and it seemed natural to assume
that they would go on developing This failed to happen partly because of the
impoverishment caused by a long series of wars and revolutions partly because
scientic and technical progress depended on the empirical habit of thought
which could not survive in a strictly regimented society As a whole the world
is more primitive today than it was fty years ago Certain backward areas
have advanced and various devices always in some way connected with warfare
and police espionage have been developed but experiment and invention have
largely stopped and the ravages of the atomic war of the nineteenfties have
never been fully repaired Nevertheless the dangers inherent in the machine are
still there From the moment when the machine rst made its appearance it was
clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery and therefore to
a great extent for human inequality had disappeared If the machine were used
deliberately for that end hunger overwork dirt illiteracy and disease could be
eliminated within a few generations And in fact without being used for any
such purpose but by a sort of automatic process  by producing wealth which
it was sometimes impossible not to distribute  the machine did raise the living
standards of the average humand being very greatly over a period of about fty
years at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries
But it was also clear that an allround increase in wealth threatened the
destruction  indeed in some sense was the destruction  of a hierarchical
society In a world in which everyone worked short hours had enough to eat
lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator and possessed a motorcar
or even an aeroplane the most obvious and perhaps the most important form
of inequality would already have disappeared If it once became general wealth
would confer no distinction It was possible no doubt to imagine a society
in which wealth in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries should be
evenly distributed while power remained in the hands of a small privileged
caste But in practice such a society could not long remain stable For if leisure
and security were enjoyed by all alike the great mass of human beings who
are normally stupeed by poverty would become literate and would learn to

===== Page 113 =====
think for themselves and when once they had done this they would sooner
or later realize that the privileged minority had no function and they would
sweep it away In the long run a hierarchical society was only possible on
a basis of poverty and ignorance To return to the agricultural past as some
thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of doing was not
a practicable solution It conicted with the tendency towards mechanization
which had become quasiinstinctive throughout almost the whole world and
moreover any country which remained industrially backward was helpless in
a military sense and was bound to be dominated directly or indirectly by its
more advanced rivals
Nor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in poverty by restricting
the output of goods This happened to a great extent during the nal phase
of capitalism roughly between  and  The economy of many countries
was allowed to stagnate land went out of cultivation capital equipment was
not added to great blocks of the population were prevented from working and
kept half alive by State charity But this too entailed military weakness and
since the privations it inicted were obviously unnecessary it made opposition
inevitable The problem was how to keep the wheels of industry turning without
increasing the real wealth of the world Goods must be produced but they
must not be distributed And in practice the only way of achieving this was by
continuous warfare
The essential act of war is destruction not necessarily of human lives but of
the products of human labour War is a way of shattering to pieces or pouring
into the stratosphere or sinking in the depths of the sea materials which might
otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable and hence in the long
run too intelligent Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed
their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without
producing anything that can be consumed A Floating Fortress for example
has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargoships
Ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete never having brought any material benet
to anybody and with further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is
built In principle the war eort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus
that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population In practice the
needs of the population are always underestimated with the result that there
is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life but this is looked on as an
advantage It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere
near the brink of hardship because a general state of scarcity increases the
importance of small privileges and thus magnies the distinction between one
group and another By the standards of the early twentieth century even a
member of the Inner Party lives an austere laborious kind of life Nevertheless
the few luxuries that he does enjoy his large wellappointed at the better
texture of his clothes the better quality of his food and drink and tobacco his
two or three servants his private motorcar or helicopter  set him in a dierent
world from a member of the Outer Party and the members of the Outer Party
have a similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we
call the proles The social atmosphere is that of a besieged city where the
possession of a lump of horseesh makes the dierence between wealth and
poverty And at the same time the consciousness of being at war and therefore
in danger makes the handingover of all power to a small caste seem the natural
unavoidable condition of survival

===== Page 114 =====
War it will be seen accomplishes the necessary destruction but accom
plishes it in a psychologically acceptable way In principle it would be quite
simple to waste the surplus labour of the world by building temples and pyra
mids by digging holes and lling them up again or even by producing vast
quantities of goods and then setting re to them But this would provide only
the economic and not the emotional basis for a hierarchical society What is
concerned here is not the morale of masses whose attitude is unimportant so
long as they are kept steadily at work but the morale of the Party itself Even
the humblest Party member is expected to be competent industrious and even
intelligent within narrow limits but it is also necessary that he should be a
credulous and ignorant fanatic whose prevailing moods are fear hatred adula
tion and orgiastic triumph In other words it is necessary that he should have
the mentality appropriate to a state of war It does not matter whether the
war is actually happening and since no decisive victory is possible it does not
matter whether the war is going well or badly All that is needed is that a state
of war should exist The splitting of the intelligence which the Party requires
of its members and which is more easily achieved in an atmosphere of war is
now almost universal but the higher up the ranks one goes the more marked it
becomes It is precisely in the Inner Party that war hysteria and hatred of the
enemy are strongest In his capacity as an administrator it is often necessary
for a member of the Inner Party to know that this or that item of war news is
untruthful and he may often be aware that the entire war is spurious and is ei
ther not happening or is being waged for purposes quite other than the declared
ones but such knowledge is easily neutralized by the technique of doublethink
Meanwhile no Inner Party member wavers for an instant in his mystical belief
that the war is real and that it is bound to end victoriously with Oceania the
undisputed master of the entire world
All members of the Inner Party believe in this coming conquest as an article
of faith It is to be achieved either by gradually acquiring more and more ter
ritory and so building up an overwhelming preponderance of power or by the
discovery of some new and unanswerable weapon The search for new weapons
continues unceasingly and is one of the very few remaining activities in which
the inventive or speculative type of mind can nd any outlet In Oceania at the
present day Science in the old sense has almost ceased to exist In Newspeak
there is no word for Science The empirical method of thought on which all
the scientic achievements of the past were founded is opposed to the most
fundamental principles of Ingsoc And even technological progress only hap
pens when its products can in some way be used for the diminution of human
liberty In all the useful arts the world is either standing still or going back
wards The elds are cultivated with horseploughs while books are written by
machinery But in matters of vital importance  meaning in eect war and
police espionage  the empirical approach is still encouraged or at least toler
ated The two aims of the Party are to conquer the whole surface of the earth
and to extinguish once and for all the possibility of independent thought There
are therefore two great problems which the Party is concerned to solve One is
how to discover against his will what another human being is thinking and
the other is how to kill several hundred million people in a few seconds without
giving warning beforehand In so far as scientic research still continues this
is its subject matter The scientist of today is either a mixture of psychologist
and inquisitor studying with real ordinary minuteness the meaning of facial

expressions gestures and tones of voice and testing the truthproducing ef
fects of drugs shock therapy hypnosis and physical torture or he is chemist
physicist or biologist concerned only with such branches of his special subject
as are relevant to the taking of life In the vast laboratories of the Ministry of
Peace and in the experimental stations hidden in the Brazilian forests or in the
Australian desert or on lost islands of the Antarctic the teams of experts are
indefatigably at work Some are concerned simply with planning the logistics
of future wars others devise larger and larger rocket bombs more and more
powerful explosives and more and more impenetrable armour plating others
search for new and deadlier gases or for soluble poisons capable of being pro
duced in such quantities as to destroy the vegetation of whole continents or for
breeds of disease germs immunized against all possible antibodies others strive
to produce a vehicle that shall bore its way under the soil like a submarine
under the water or an aeroplane as independent of its base as a sailingship
others explore even remoter possibilities such as focusing the suns rays through
lenses suspended thousands of kilometres away in space or producing articial
earthquakes and tidal waves by tapping the heat at the earths centre
But none of these projects ever comes anywhere near realization and none
of the three superstates ever gains a signicant lead on the others What is
more remarkable is that all three powers already possess in the atomic bomb
a weapon far more powerful than any that their present researches are likely to
discover Although the Party according to its habit claims the invention for
itself atomic bombs rst appeared as early as the nineteenforties and were
rst used on a large scale about ten years later At that time some hundreds of
bombs were dropped on industrial centres chiey in European Russia Western
Europe and North America The eect was to convince the ruling groups of
all countries that a few more atomic bombs would mean the end of organized
society and hence of their own power Thereafter although no formal agree
ment was ever made or hinted at no more bombs were dropped All three
powers merely continue to produce atomic bombs and store them up against
the decisive opportunity which they all believe will come sooner or later And
meanwhile the art of war has remained almost stationary for thirty or forty
years Helicopters are more used than they were formerly bombing planes have
been largely superseded by selfpropelled projectiles and the fragile movable
battleship has given way to the almost unsinkable Floating Fortress but other
wise there has been little development The tank the submarine the torpedo
the machine gun even the rie and the hand grenade are still in use And
in spite of the endless slaughters reported in the Press and on the telescreens
the desperate battles of earlier wars in which hundreds of thousands or even
millions of men were often killed in a few weeks have never been repeated
None of the three superstates ever attempts any manoeuvre which involves
the risk of serious defeat When any large operation is undertaken it is usually
a surprise attack against an ally The strategy that all three powers are follow
ing or pretend to themselves that they are following is the same The plan is
by a combination of ghting bargaining and welltimed strokes of treachery to
acquire a ring of bases completely encircling one or other of the rival states and
then to sign a pact of friendship with that rival and remain on peaceful terms
for so many years as to lull suspicion to sleep During this time rockets loaded
with atomic bombs can be assembled at all the strategic spots nally they will
all be red simultaneously with eects so devastating as to make retaliation

===== Page 116 =====
impossible It will then be time to sign a pact of friendship with the remain
ing worldpower in preparation for another attack This scheme it is hardly
necessary to say is a mere daydream impossible of realization Moreover no
ghting ever occurs except in the disputed areas round the Equator and the
Pole no invasion of enemy territory is ever undertaken This explains the fact
that in some places the frontiers between the superstates are arbitrary Eurasia
for example could easily conquer the British Isles which are geographically
part of Europe or on the other hand it would be possible for Oceania to push
its frontiers to the Rhine or even to the Vistula But this would violate the
principle followed on all sides though never formulated of cultural integrity If
Oceania were to conquer the areas that used once to be known as France and
Germany it would be necessary either to exterminate the inhabitants a task of
great physical diculty or to assimilate a population of about a hundred million
people who so far as technical development goes are roughly on the Oceanic
level The problem is the same for all three superstates It is absolutely neces
sary to their structure that there should be no contact with foreigners except
to a limited extent with war prisoners and coloured slaves Even the ocial
ally of the moment is always regarded with the darkest suspicion War prisoners
apart the average citizen of Oceania never sets eyes on a citizen of either Eura
sia or Eastasia and he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages If he
were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are creatures
similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about them is lies
The sealed world in which he lives would be broken and the fear hatred and
selfrighteousness on which his morale depends might evaporate It is therefore
realized on all sides that however often Persia or Egypt or Java or Ceylon
may change hands the main frontiers must never be crossed by anything except
bombs
Under this lies a fact never mentioned aloud but tacitly understood and
acted upon namely that the conditions of life in all three superstates are very
much the same In Oceania the prevailing philosophy is called Ingsoc in Eurasia
it is called NeoBolshevism and in Eastasia it is called by a Chinese name usu
ally translated as DeathWorship but perhaps better rendered as Obliteration
of the Self The citizen of Oceania is not allowed to know anything of the tenets
of the other two philosophies but he is taught to execrate them as barbarous
outrages upon morality and common sense Actually the three philosophies
are barely distinguishable and the social systems which they support are not
distinguishable at all Everywhere there is the same pyramidal structure the
same worship of semidivine leader the same economy existing by and for con
tinuous warfare It follows that the three superstates not only cannot conquer
one another but would gain no advantage by doing so On the contrary so
long as they remain in conict they prop one another up like three sheaves of
corn And as usual the ruling groups of all three powers are simultaneously
aware and unaware of what they are doing Their lives are dedicated to world
conquest but they also know that it is necessary that the war should continue
everlastingly and without victory Meanwhile the fact that there is no danger
of conquest makes possible the denial of reality which is the special feature of
Ingsoc and its rival systems of thought Here it is necessary to repeat what has
been said earlier that by becoming continuous war has fundamentally changed
its character
In past ages a war almost by denition was something that sooner or later

===== Page 117 =====
came to an end usually in unmistakable victory or defeat In the past also
war was one of the main instruments by which human societies were kept in
touch with physical reality All rulers in all ages have tried to impose a false
view of the world upon their followers but they could not aord to encourage
any illusion that tended to impair military eciency So long as defeat meant
the loss of independence or some other result generally held to be undesirable
the precautions against defeat had to be serious Physical facts could not be
ignored In philosophy or religion or ethics or politics two and two might
make ve but when one was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make
four Inecient nations were always conquered sooner or later and the struggle
for eciency was inimical to illusions Moreover to be ecient it was necessary
to be able to learn from the past which meant having a fairly accurate idea of
what had happened in the past Newspapers and history books were of course
always coloured and biased but falsication of the kind that is practised today
would have been impossible War was a sure safeguard of sanity and so far
as the ruling classes were concerned it was probably the most important of all
safeguards While wars could be won or lost no ruling class could be completely
irresponsible
But when war becomes literally continuous it also ceases to be dangerous
When war is continuous there is no such thing as military necessity Technical
progress can cease and the most palpable facts can be denied or disregarded As
we have seen researches that could be called scientic are still carried out for
the purposes of war but they are essentially a kind of daydreaming and their
failure to show results is not important Eciency even military eciency is
no longer needed Nothing is ecient in Oceania except the Thought Police
Since each of the three superstates is unconquerable each is in eect a separate
universe within which almost any perversion of thought can be safely practised
Reality only exerts its pressure through the needs of everyday life  the need
to eat and drink to get shelter and clothing to avoid swallowing poison or
stepping out of topstorey windows and the like Between life and death and
between physical pleasure and physical pain there is still a distinction but that
is all Cut o from contact with the outer world and with the past the citizen
of Oceania is like a man in interstellar space who has no way of knowing which
direction is up and which is down The rulers of such a state are absolute as
the Pharaohs or the Caesars could not be They are obliged to prevent their
followers from starving to death in numbers large enough to be inconvenient
and they are obliged to remain at the same low level of military technique as
their rivals but once that minimum is achieved they can twist reality into
whatever shape they choose
The war therefore if we judge it by the standards of previous wars is
merely an imposture It is like the battles between certain ruminant animals
whose horns are set at such an angle that they are incapable of hurting one
another But though it is unreal it is not meaningless It eats up the surplus of
consumable goods and it helps to preserve the special mental atmosphere that a
hierarchical society needs War it will be seen is now a purely internal aair In
the past the ruling groups of all countries although they might recognize their
common interest and therefore limit the destructiveness of war did ght against
one another and the victor always plundered the vanquished In our own day
they are not ghting against one another at all The war is waged by each
ruling group against its own subjects and the object of the war is not to make

or prevent conquests of territory but to keep the structure of society intact
The very word war therefore has become misleading It would probably be
accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to exist The
peculiar pressure that it exerted on human beings between the Neolithic Age
and the early twentieth century has disappeared and been replaced by something
quite dierent The eect would be much the same if the three superstates
instead of ghting one another should agree to live in perpetual peace each
inviolate within its own boundaries For in that case each would still be a
selfcontained universe freed for ever from the sobering inuence of external
danger A peace that was truly permanent would be the same as a permanent
war This  although the vast majority of Party members understand it only
in a shallower sense  is the inner meaning of the Party slogan War is Peace
Winston stopped reading for a moment Somewhere in remote distance a
rocket bomb thundered The blissful feeling of being alone with the forbidden
book in a room with no telescreen had not worn o Solitude and safety
were physical sensations mixed up somehow with the tiredness of his body
the softness of the chair the touch of the faint breeze from the window that
played upon his cheek The book fascinated him or more exactly it reassured
him In a sense it told him nothing that was new but that was part of the
attraction It said what he would have said if it had been possible for him to
set his scattered thoughts in order It was the product of a mind similar to
his own but enormously more powerful more systematic less fearridden The
best books he perceived are those that tell you what you know already He
had just turned back to Chapter I when he heard Julias footstep on the stair
and started out of his chair to meet her She dumped her brown toolbag on
the oor and ung herself into his arms It was more than a week since they
had seen one another
Ive got the book he said as they disentangled themselves
Oh youve got it Good she said without much interest and almost
immediately knelt down beside the oilstove to make the coee
They did not return to the subject until they had been in bed for half an
hour The evening was just cool enough to make it worth while to pull up the
counterpane From below came the familiar sound of singing and the scrape
of boots on the agstones The brawny redarmed woman whom Winston had
seen there on his rst visit was almost a xture in the yard There seemed to be
no hour of daylight when she was not marching to and fro between the washtub
and the line alternately gagging herself with clothes pegs and breaking forth
into lusty song Julia had settled down on her side and seemed to be already
on the point of falling asleep He reached out for the book which was lying on
the oor and sat up against the bedhead
We must read it he said You too All members of the Brotherhood have
to read it
You read it she said with her eyes shut Read it aloud Thats the best
way Then you can explain it to me as you go
The clocks hands said six meaning eighteen They had three or four hours
ahead of them He propped the book against his knees and began reading
Chapter I
Ignorance is Strength
Throughout recorded time and probably since the end of the Neolithic Age
there have been three kinds of people in the world the High the Middle and

===== Page 119 =====
the Low They have been subdivided in many ways they have borne countless
dierent names and their relative numbers as well as their attitude towards
one another have varied from age to age but the essential structure of society
has never altered Even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable
changes the same pattern has always reasserted itself just as a gyroscope will
always return to equilibnum however far it is pushed one way or the other
Julia are you awake said Winston
Yes my love Im listening Go on Its marvellous
He continued reading
The aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable The aim of the
High is to remain where they are The aim of the Middle is to change places
with the High The aim of the Low when they have an aim  for it is an
abiding characteristic of the Low that they are too much crushed by drudgery
to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily lives 
is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equal
Thus throughout history a struggle which is the same in its main outlines recurs
over and over again For long periods the High seem to be securely in power
but sooner or later there always comes a moment when they lose either their
belief in themselves or their capacity to govern eciently or both They are
then overthrown by the Middle who enlist the Low on their side by pretending
to them that they are ghting for liberty and justice As soon as they have
reached their objective the Middle thrust the Low back into their old position
of servitude and themselves become the High Presently a new Middle group
splits o from one of the other groups or from both of them and the struggle
begins over again Of the three groups only the Low are never even temporarily
successful in achieving their aims It would be an exaggeration to say that
throughout history there has been no progress of a material kind Even today
in a period of decline the average human being is physically better o than he
was a few centuries ago But no advance in wealth no softening of manners
no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimetre nearer
From the point of view of the Low no historic change has ever meant much
more than a change in the name of their masters
By the late nineteenth century the recurrence of this pattern had become
obvious to many observers There then rose schools of thinkers who interpreted
history as a cyclical process and claimed to show that inequality was the unalter
able law of human life This doctrine of course had always had its adherents
but in the manner in which it was now put forward there was a signicant
change In the past the need for a hierarchical form of society had been the
doctrine specically of the High It had been preached by kings and aristocrats
and by the priests lawyers and the like who were parasitical upon them and it
had generally been softened by promises of compensation in an imaginary world
beyond the grave The Middle so long as it was struggling for power had al
ways made use of such terms as freedom justice and fraternity Now however
the concept of human brotherhood began to be assailed by people who were not
yet in positions of command but merely hoped to be so before long In the
past the Middle had made revolutions under the banner of equality and then
had established a fresh tyranny as soon as the old one was overthrown The
new Middle groups in eect proclaimed their tyranny beforehand Socialism
a theory which appeared in the early nineteenth century and was the last link
in a chain of thought stretching back to the slave rebellions of antiquity was

===== Page 120 =====
still deeply infected by the Utopianism of past ages But in each variant of So
cialism that appeared from about  onwards the aim of establishing liberty
and equality was more and more openly abandoned The new movements which
appeared in the middle years of the century Ingsoc in Oceania NeoBolshevism
in Eurasia DeathWorship as it is commonly called in Eastasia had the con
scious aim of perpetuating unfreedom and inequality These new movements
of course grew out of the old ones and tended to keep their names and pay lip
service to their ideology But the purpose of all of them was to arrest progress
and freeze history at a chosen moment The familiar pendulum swing was to
happen once more and then stop As usual the High were to be turned out
by the Middle who would then become the High but this time by conscious
strategy the High would be able to maintain their position permanently
The new doctrines arose partly because of the accumulation of historical
knowledge and the growth of the historical sense which had hardly existed
before the nineteenth century The cyclical movement of history was now in
telligible or appeared to be so and if it was intelligible then it was alterable
But the principal underlying cause was that as early as the beginning of the
twentieth century human equality had become technically possible It was still
true that men were not equal in their native talents and that functions had
to be specialized in ways that favoured some individuals against others but
there was no longer any real need for class distinctions or for large dierences
of wealth In earlier ages class distinctions had been not only inevitable but
desirable Inequality was the price of civilization With the development of ma
chine production however the case was altered Even if it was still necessary
for human beings to do dierent kinds of work it was no longer necessary for
them to live at dierent social or economic levels Therefore from the point of
view of the new groups who were on the point of seizing power human equality
was no longer an ideal to be striven after but a danger to be averted In more
primitive ages when a just and peaceful society was in fact not possible it had
been fairly easy to believe it The idea of an earthly paradise in which men
should live together in a state of brotherhood without laws and without brute
labour had haunted the human imagination for thousands of years And this
vision had had a certain hold even on the groups who actually proted by each
historical change The heirs of the French English and American revolutions
had partly believed in their own phrases about the rights of man freedom of
speech equality before the law and the like and have even allowed their con
duct to be inuenced by them to some extent But by the fourth decade of
the twentieth century all the main currents of political thought were authori
tarian The earthly paradise had been discredited at exactly the moment when
it became realizable Every new political theory by whatever name it called
itself led back to hierarchy and regimentation And in the general hardening
of outlook that set in round about  practices which had been long aban
doned in some cases for hundreds of years  imprisonment without trial the
use of war prisoners as slaves public executions torture to extract confessions
the use of hostages and the deportation of whole populationsnot only became
common again but were tolerated and even defended by people who considered
themselves enlightened and progressive
It was only after a decade of national wars civil wars revolutions and
counterrevolutions in all parts of the world that Ingsoc and its rivals emerged
as fully workedout political theories But they had been foreshadowed by the

===== Page 121 =====
various systems generally called totalitarian which had appeared earlier in
the century and the main outlines of the world which would emerge from the
prevailing chaos had long been obvious What kind of people would control this
world had been equally obvious The new aristocracy was made up for the most
part of bureaucrats scientists technicians tradeunion organizers publicity
experts sociologists teachers journalists and professional politicians These
people whose origins lay in the salaried middle class and the upper grades of
the working class had been shaped and brought together by the barren world
of monopoly industry and centralized government As compared with their
opposite numbers in past ages they were less avaricious less tempted by luxury
hungrier for pure power and above all more conscious of what they were doing
and more intent on crushing opposition This last dierence was cardinal By
comparison with that existing today all the tyrannies of the past were half
hearted and inecient The ruling groups were always infected to some extent
by liberal ideas and were content to leave loose ends everywhere to regard only
the overt act and to be uninterested in what their subjects were thinking Even
the Catholic Church of the Middle Ages was tolerant by modern standards Part
of the reason for this was that in the past no government had the power to keep
its citizens under constant surveillance The invention of print however made
it easier to manipulate public opinion and the lm and the radio carried the
process further With the development of television and the technical advance
which made it possible to receive and transmit simultaneously on the same
instrument private life came to an end Every citizen or at least every citizen
important enough to be worth watching could be kept for twentyfour hours a
day under the eyes of the police and in the sound of ocial propaganda with all
other channels of communication closed The possibility of enforcing not only
complete obedience to the will of the State but complete uniformity of opinion
on all subjects now existed for the rst time
After the revolutionary period of the fties and sixties society regrouped
itself as always into High Middle and Low But the new High group unlike all
its forerunners did not act upon instinct but knew what was needed to safeguard
its position It had long been realized that the only secure basis for oligarchy
is collectivism Wealth and privilege are most easily defended when they are
possessed jointly The socalled abolition of private property which took place
in the middle years of the century meant in eect the concentration of property
in far fewer hands than before but with this dierence that the new owners
were a group instead of a mass of individuals Individually no member of the
Party owns anything except petty personal belongings Collectively the Party
owns everything in Oceania because it controls everything and disposes of the
products as it thinks t In the years following the Revolution it was able to step
into this commanding position almost unopposed because the whole process was
represented as an act of collectivization It had always been assumed that if the
capitalist class were expropriated Socialism must follow and unquestionably
the capitalists had been expropriated Factories mines land houses transport
 everything had been taken away from them and since these things were no
longer private property it followed that they must be public property Ingsoc
which grew out of the earlier Socialist movement and inherited its phraseology
has in fact carried out the main item in the Socialist programme with the
result foreseen and intended beforehand that economic inequality has been
made permanent

But the problems of perpetuating a hierarchical society go deeper than this
There are only four ways in which a ruling group can fall from power Either
it is conquered from without or it governs so ineciently that the masses are
stirred to revolt or it allows a strong and discontented Middle group to come
into being or it loses its own selfcondence and willingness to govern These
causes do not operate singly and as a rule all four of them are present in some
degree A ruling class which could guard against all of them would remain in
power permanently Ultimately the determining factor is the mental attitude of
the ruling class itself
After the middle of the present century the rst danger had in reality dis
appeared Each of the three powers which now divide the world is in fact
unconquerable and could only become conquerable through slow demographic
changes which a government with wide powers can easily avert The second
danger also is only a theoretical one The masses never revolt of their own
accord and they never revolt merely because they are oppressed Indeed so
long as they are not permitted to have standards of comparison they never
even become aware that they are oppressed The recurrent economic crises of
past times were totally unnecessary and are not now permitted to happen but
other and equally large dislocations can and do happen without having political
results because there is no way in which discontent can become articulate As
fcr the problem of overproduction which has been latent in our society since
the development of machine technique it is solved by the device of continuous
warfare see Chapter III which is also useful in keying up public morale to the
necessary pitch From the point of view of our present rulers therefore the only
genuine dangers are the splittingo of a new group of able underemployed
powerhungry people and the growth of liberalism and scepticism in their own
ranks The problem that is to say is educational It is a problem of continu
ously moulding the consciousness both of the directing group and of the larger
executive group that lies immediately below it The consciousness of the masses
needs only to be inuenced in a negative way
Given this background one could infer if one did not know it already
the general structure of Oceanic society At the apex of the pyramid comes
Big Brother Big Brother is infallible and allpowerful Every success every
achievement every victory every scientic discovery all knowledge all wisdom
all happiness all virtue are held to issue directly from his leadership and in
spiration Nobody has ever seen Big Brother He is a face on the hoardings a
voice on the telescreen We may be reasonably sure that he will never die and
there is already considerable uncertainty as to when he was born Big Brother is
the guise in which the Party chooses to exhibit itself to the world His function
is to act as a focusing point for love fear and reverence emotions which are
more easily felt towards an individual than towards an organization Below Big
Brother comes the Inner Party its numbers limited to six millions or something
less than  per cent of the population of Oceania Below the Inner Party comes
the Outer Party which if the Inner Party is described as the brain of the State
may be justly likened to the hands Below that come the dumb masses whom
we habitually refer to as the proles numbering perhaps  per cent of the
population In the terms of our earlier classication the proles are the Low for
the slave population of the equatorial lands who pass constantly from conqueror
to conqueror are not a permanent or necessary part of the structure
In principle membership of these three groups is not hereditary The child

===== Page 123 =====
of Inner Party parents is in theory not born into the Inner Party Admission to
either branch of the Party is by examination taken at the age of sixteen Nor
is there any racial discrimination or any marked domination of one province
by another Jews Negroes South Americans of pure Indian blood are to be
found in the highest ranks of the Party and the administrators of any area
are always drawn from the inhabitants of that area In no part of Oceania
do the inhabitants have the feeling that they are a colonial population ruled
from a distant capital Oceania has no capital and its titular head is a person
whose whereabouts nobody knows Except that English is its chief lingua franca
and Newspeak its ocial language it is not centralized in any way Its rulers
are not held together by bloodties but by adherence to a common doctrine
It is true that our society is stratied and very rigidly stratied on what at
rst sight appear to be hereditary lines There is far less to andfro movement
between the dierent groups than happened under capitalism or even in the pre
industrial age Between the two branches of the Party there is a certain amount
of interchange but only so much as will ensure that weaklings are excluded
from the Inner Party and that ambitious members of the Outer Party are made
harmless by allowing them to rise Proletarians in practice are not allowed
to graduate into the Party The most gifted among them who might possibly
become nuclei of discontent are simply marked down by the Thought Police
and eliminated But this state of aairs is not necessarily permanent nor is it
a matter of principle The Party is not a class in the old sense of the word It
does not aim at transmitting power to its own children as such and if there
were no other way of keeping the ablest people at the top it would be perfectly
prepared to recruit an entire new generation from the ranks of the proletariat
In the crucial years the fact that the Party was not a hereditary body did a
great deal to neutralize opposition The older kind of Socialist who had been
trained to ght against something called class privilege assumed that what
is not hereditary cannot be permanent He did not see that the continuity of
an oligarchy need not be physical nor did he pause to reect that hereditary
aristocracies have always been shortlived whereas adoptive organizations such
as the Catholic Church have sometimes lasted for hundreds or thousands of
years The essence of oligarchical rule is not fathertoson inheritance but the
persistence of a certain worldview and a certain way of life imposed by the dead
upon the living A ruling group is a ruling group so long as it can nominate
its successors The Party is not concerned with perpetuating its blood but
with perpetuating itself Who wields power is not important provided that the
hierarchical structure remains always the same
All the beliefs habits tastes emotions mental attitudes that characterize
our time are really designed to sustain the mystique of the Party and prevent
the true nature of presentday society from being perceived Physical rebellion
or any preliminary move towards rebellion is at present not possible From the
proletarians nothing is to be feared Left to themselves they will continue from
generation to generation and from century to century working breeding and
dying not only without any impulse to rebel but without the power of grasping
that the world could be other than it is They could only become dangerous
if the advance of industrial technique made it necessary to educate them more
highly but since military and commercial rivalry are no longer important the
level of popular education is actually declining What opinions the masses hold
or do not hold is looked on as a matter of indierence They can be granted

intellectual liberty because they have no intellect In a Party member on the
other hand not even the smallest deviation of opinion on the most unimportant
subject can be tolerated
A Party member lives from birth to death under the eye of the Thought
Police Even when he is alone he can never be sure that he is alone Wher
ever he may be asleep or awake working or resting in his bath or in bed he
can be inspected without warning and without knowing that he is being in
spected Nothing that he does is indierent His friendships his relaxations
his behaviour towards his wife and children the expression of his face when
he is alone the words he mutters in sleep even the characteristic movements
of his body are all jealously scrutinized Not only any actual misdemeanour
but any eccentricity however small any change of habits any nervous man
nerism that could possibly be the symptom of an inner struggle is certain to
be detected He has no freedom of choice in any direction whatever On the
other hand his actions are not regulated by law or by any clearly formulated
code of behaviour In Oceania there is no law Thoughts and actions which
when detected mean certain death are not formally forbidden and the endless
purges arrests tortures imprisonments and vaporizations are not inicted as
punishment for crimes which have actually been committed but are merely the
wipingout of persons who might perhaps commit a crime at some time in the
future A Party member is required to have not only the right opinions but the
right instincts Many of the beliefs and attitudes demanded of him are never
plainly stated and could not be stated without laying bare the contradictions
inherent in Ingsoc If he is a person naturally orthodox in Newspeak a good
thinker he will in all circumstances know without taking thought what is
the true belief or the desirable emotion But in any case an elaborate mental
training undergone in childhood and grouping itself round the Newspeak words
crimestop blackwhite and doublethink makes him unwilling and unable to
think too deeply on any subject whatever
A Party member is expected to have no private emotions and no respites from
enthusiasm He is supposed to live in a continuous frenzy of hatred of foreign
enemies and internal traitors triumph over victories and selfabasement before
the power and wisdom of the Party The discontents produced by his bare
unsatisfying life are deliberately turned outwards and dissipated by such devices
as the Two Minutes Hate and the speculations which might possibly induce a
sceptical or rebellious attitude are killed in advance by his early acquired inner
discipline The rst and simplest stage in the discipline which can be taught
even to young children is called in Newspeak crimestop Crimestop means
the faculty of stopping short as though by instinct at the threshold of any
dangerous thought It includes the power of not grasping analogies of failing
to perceive logical errors of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if they
are inimical to Ingsoc and of being bored or repelled by any train of thought
which is capable of leading in a heretical direction Crimestop in short means
protective stupidity But stupidity is not enough On the contrary orthodoxy
in the full sense demands a control over ones own mental processes as complete
as that of a contortionist over his body Oceanic society rests ultimately on the
belief that Big Brother is omnipotent and that the Party is infallible But since
in reality Big Brother is not omnipotent and the party is not infallible there is
need for an unwearying momenttomoment exibility in the treatment of facts
The keyword here is blackwhite Like so many Newspeak words this word has

===== Page 125 =====
two mutually contradictory meanings Applied to an opponent it means the
habit of impudently claiming that black is white in contradiction of the plain
facts Applied to a Party member it means a loyal willingness to say that black
is white when Party discipline demands this But it means also the ability to
believe that black is white and more to know that black is white and to forget
that one has ever believed the contrary This demands a continuous alteration
of the past made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all
the rest and which is known in Newspeak as doublethink
The alteration of the past is necessary for two reasons one of which is sub
sidiary and so to speak precautionary The subsidiary reason is that the Party
member like the proletarian tolerates presentday conditions partly because
he has no standards of comparison He must be cut o from the past just as
he must be cut o from foreign countries because it is necessary for him to
believe that he is better o than his ancestors and that the average level of
material comfort is constantly rising But by far the more important reason
for the readjustment of the past is the need to safeguard the infallibility of the
Party It is not merely that speeches statistics and records of every kind must
be constantly brought up to date in order to show that the predictions of the
Party were in all cases right It is also that no change in doctrine or in political
alignment can ever be admitted For to change ones mind or even ones policy
is a confession of weakness If for example Eurasia or Eastasia whichever it
may be is the enemy today then that country must always have been the en
emy And if the facts say otherwise then the facts must be altered Thus history
is continuously rewritten This daytoday falsication of the past carried out
by the Ministry of Truth is as necessary to the stability of the regime as the
work of repression and espionage carried out by the Ministry of Love
The mutability of the past is the central tenet of Ingsoc Past events it is
argued have no objective existence but survive only in written records and in
human memories The past is whatever the records and the memories agree
upon And since the Party is in full control of all records and in equally full
control of the minds of its members it follows that the past is whatever the Party
chooses to make it It also follows that though the past is alterable it never has
been altered in any specic instance For when it has been recreated in whatever
shape is needed at the moment then this new version is the past and no dierent
past can ever have existed This holds good even when as often happens the
same event has to be altered out of recognition several times in the course of a
year At all times the Party is in possession of absolute truth and clearly the
absolute can never have been dierent from what it is now It will be seen that
the control of the past depends above all on the training of memory To make
sure that all written records agree with the orthodoxy of the moment is merely
a mechanical act But it is also necessary to remember that events happened
in the desired manner And if it is necessary to rearrange ones memories or to
tamper with written records then it is necessary to forget that one has done
so The trick of doing this can be learned like any other mental technique
It is learned by the majority of Party members and certainly by all who are
intelligent as well as orthodox In Oldspeak it is called quite frankly reality
control In Newspeak it is called doublethink though doublethink comprises
much else as well
Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in ones
mind simultaneously and accepting both of them The Party intellectual knows

===== Page 126 =====
in which direction his memories must be altered he therefore knows that he is
playing tricks with reality but by the exercise of doublethink he also satises
himself that reality is not violated The process has to be conscious or it would
not be carried out with sucient precision but it also has to be unconscious
or it would bring with it a feeling of falsity and hence of guilt Doublethink
lies at the very heart of Ingsoc since the essential act of the Party is to use
conscious deception while retaining the rmness of purpose that goes with com
plete honesty To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them to forget
any fact that has become inconvenient and then when it becomes necessary
again to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed to deny
the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality
which one denies  all this is indispensably necessary Even in using the word
doublethink it is necessary to exercise doublethink For by using the word one
admits that one is tampering with reality by a fresh act of doublethink one
erases this knowledge and so on indenitely with the lie always one leap ahead
of the truth Ultimately it is by means of doublethink that the Party has been
able  and may for all we know continue to be able for thousands of years 
to arrest the course of history
All past oligarchies have fallen from power either because they ossied or be
cause they grew soft Either they became stupid and arrogant failed to adjust
themselves to changing circumstances and were overthrown or they became
liberal and cowardly made concessions when they should have used force and
once again were overthrown They fell that is to say either through conscious
ness or through unconsciousness It is the achievement of the Party to have
produced a system of thought in which both conditions can exist simultane
ously And upon no other intellectual basis could the dominion of the Party be
made permanent If one is to rule and to continue ruling one must be able to
dislocate the sense of reality For the secret of rulership is to combine a belief
in ones own infallibility with the Power to learn from past mistakes
It need hardly be said that the subtlest practitioners of doublethink are those
who invented doublethink and know that it is a vast system of mental cheating
In our society those who have the best knowledge of what is happening are also
those who are furthest from seeing the world as it is In general the greater the
understanding the greater the delusion the more intelligent the less sane One
clear illustration of this is the fact that war hysteria increases in intensity as one
rises in the social scale Those whose attitude towards the war is most nearly
rational are the subject peoples of the disputed territories To these people the
war is simply a continuous calamity which sweeps to and fro over their bodies
like a tidal wave Which side is winning is a matter of complete indierence to
them They are aware that a change of overlordship means simply that they will
be doing the same work as before for new masters who treat them in the same
manner as the old ones The slightly more favoured workers whom we call the
proles are only intermittently conscious of the war When it is necessary they
can be prodded into frenzies of fear and hatred but when left to themselves they
are capable of forgetting for long periods that the war is happening It is in the
ranks of the Party and above all of the Inner Party that the true war enthusiasm
is found Worldconquest is believed in most rmly by those who know it to
be impossible This peculiar linkingtogether of opposites  knowledge with
ignorance cynicism with fanaticismis one of the chief distinguishing marks of
Oceanic society The ocial ideology abounds with contradictions even when

===== Page 127 =====
there is no practical reason for them Thus the Party rejects and vilies every
principle for which the Socialist movement originally stood and it chooses to
do this in the name of Socialism It preaches a contempt for the working class
unexampled for centuries past and it dresses its members in a uniform which
was at one time peculiar to manual workers and was adopted for that reason It
systematically undermines the solidarity of the family and it calls its leader by a
name which is a direct appeal to the sentiment of family loyalty Even the names
of the four Ministries by which we are governed exhibit a sort of impudence in
their deliberate reversal of the facts The Ministry of Peace concerns itself with
war the Ministry of Truth with lies the Ministry of Love with torture and the
Ministry of Plenty with starvation These contradictions are not accidental
nor do they result from ordinary hypocrisy they are deliberate exercises in
doublethink For it is only by reconciling contradictions that power can be
retained indenitely In no other way could the ancient cycle be broken If
human equality is to be for ever averted  if the High as we have called them
are to keep their places permanently  then the prevailing mental condition
must be controlled insanity
But there is one question which until this moment we have almost ignored
It is why should human equality be averted Supposing that the mechanics
of the process have been rightly described what is the motive for this huge
accurately planned eort to freeze history at a particular moment of time
Here we reach the central secret As we have seen the mystique of the
Party and above all of the Inner Party depends upon doublethink But deeper
than this lies the original motive the neverquestioned instinct that rst led to
the seizure of power and brought doublethink the Thought Police continuous
warfare and all the other necessary paraphernalia into existence afterwards
This motive really consists  Winston became aware of silence as one becomes
aware of a new sound It seemed to him that Julia had been very still for some
time past She was lying on her side naked from the waist upwards with her
cheek pillowed on her hand and one dark lock tumbling across her eyes Her
breast rose and fell slowly and regularly
Julia
No answer
Julia are you awake
No answer She was asleep He shut the book put it carefully on the oor
lay down and pulled the coverlet over both of them
He had still he reected not learned the ultimate secret He understood
how he did not understand why Chapter I like Chapter III had not actu
ally told him anything that he did not know it had merely systematized the
knowledge that he possessed already But after reading it he knew better than
before that he was not mad Being in a minority even a minority of one did
not make you mad There was truth and there was untruth and if you clung
to the truth even against the whole world you were not mad A yellow beam
from the sinking sun slanted in through the window and fell across the pillow
He shut his eyes The sun on his face and the girls smooth body touching his
own gave him a strong sleepy condent feeling He was safe everything was
all right He fell asleep murmuring Sanity is not statistical with the feeling
that this remark contained in it a profound wisdom When he woke it was with
the sensation of having slept for a long time but a glance at the oldfashioned
clock told him that it was only twentythirty He lay dozing for a while then

stretched herself luxuriously and got out of bed
Im hungry she said Lets make some more coee Damn The stoves
gone out and the waters cold She picked the stove up and shook it Theres
no oil in it
We can get some from old Charrington I expect
The funny thing is I made sure it was full Im going to put my clothes on
she added It seems to have got colder
Winston also got up and dressed himself The indefatigable voice sang on
They sye that time eals all things
They sye you can always forget
But the smiles an the tears acrorss the years
They twist my eartstrings yet
As he fastened the belt of his overalls he strolled across to the window The
sun must have gone down behind the houses it was not shining into the yard any
longer The agstones were wet as though they had just been washed and he
had the feeling that the sky had been washed too so fresh and pale was the blue
between the chimneypots Tirelessly the woman marched to and fro corking
and uncorking herself singing and falling silent and pegging out more diapers
and more and yet more He wondered whether she took in washing for a living or
was merely the slave of twenty or thirty grandchildren Julia had come across to
his side together they gazed down with a sort of fascination at the sturdy gure
below As he looked at the woman in her characteristic attitude her thick arms
reaching up for the line her powerful marelike buttocks protruded it struck
him for the rst time that she was beautiful It had never before occurred to
him that the body of a woman of fty blown up to monstrous dimensions by
childbearing then hardened roughened by work till it was coarse in the grain
like an overripe turnip could be beautiful But it was so and after all he
thought why not The solid contourless body like a block of granite and the
rasping red skin bore the same relation to the body of a girl as the rosehip to
the rose Why should the fruit be held inferior to the ower
Shes beautiful he murmured
Shes a metre across the hips easily said Julia
That is her style of beauty said Winston
He held Julias supple waist easily encircled by his arm From the hip to
the knee her ank was against his Out of their bodies no child would ever
come That was the one thing they could never do Only by word of mouth
from mind to mind could they pass on the secret The woman down there
had no mind she had only strong arms a warm heart and a fertile belly He
wondered how many children she had given birth to It might easily be fteen
She had had her momentary owering a year perhaps of wildrose beauty and
then she had suddenly swollen like a fertilized fruit and grown hard and red
and coarse and then her life had been laundering scrubbing darning cooking
sweeping polishing mending scrubbing laundering rst for children then for

grandchildren over thirty unbroken years At the end of it she was still singing
The mystical reverence that he felt for her was somehow mixed up with the
aspect of the pale cloudless sky stretching away behind the chimneypots into
interminable distance It was curious to think that the sky was the same for
everybody in Eurasia or Eastasia as well as here And the people under the sky
were also very much the same  everywhere all over the world hundreds of
thousands of millions of people just like this people ignorant of one anothers
existence held apart by walls of hatred and lies and yet almost exactly the
same  people who had never learned to think but who were storing up in
their hearts and bellies and muscles the power that would one day overturn the
world If there was hope it lay in the proles Without having read to the end
of the book he knew that that must be Goldsteins nal message The future
belonged to the proles And could he be sure that when their time came the
world they constructed would not be just as alien to him Winston Smith as
the world of the Party Yes because at the least it would be a world of sanity
Where there is equality there can be sanity Sooner or later it would happen
strength would change into consciousness The proles were immortal you could
not doubt it when you looked at that valiant gure in the yard In the end
their awakening would come And until that happened though it might be a
thousand years they would stay alive against all the odds like birds passing
on from body to body the vitality which the Party did not share and could not
kill
Do you remember he said the thrush that sang to us that rst day at
the edge of the wood
He wasnt singing to us said Julia He was singing to please himself Not
even that He was just singing
The birds sang the proles sang the Party did not sing All round the world
in London and New York in Africa and Brazil and in the mysterious forbidden
lands beyond the frontiers in the streets of Paris and Berlin in the villages of the
endless Russian plain in the bazaars of China and Japan  everywhere stood
the same solid unconquerable gure made monstrous by work and childbearing
toiling from birth to death and still singing Out of those mighty loins a race of
conscious beings must one day come You were the dead theirs was the future
But you could share in that future if you kept alive the mind as they kept alive
the body and passed on the secret doctrine that two plus two make four
We are the dead he said
We are the dead echoed Julia dutifully
You are the dead said an iron voice behind them
They sprang apart Winstons entrails seemed to have turned into ice He
could see the white all round the irises of Julias eyes Her face had turned a
milky yellow The smear of rouge that was still on each cheekbone stood out
sharply almost as though unconnected with the skin beneath
You are the dead repeated the iron voice
It was behind the picture breathed Julia
It was behind the picture said the voice Remain exactly where you are
Make no movement until you are ordered
It was starting it was starting at last They could do nothing except stand
gazing into one anothers eyes To run for life to get out of the house before
it was too late  no such thought occurred to them Unthinkable to disobey
the iron voice from the wall There was a snap as though a catch had been

turned back and a crash of breaking glass The picture had fallen to the oor
uncovering the telescreen behind it
Now they can see us said Julia
 Now we can see you said the voice  Stand out in the middle of the room
Stand back to back Clasp your hands behind your heads Do not touch one
another
They were not touching but it seemed to him that he could feel Julias body
shaking Or perhaps it was merely the shaking of his own He could just stop
his teeth from chattering but his knees were beyond his control There was a
sound of trampling boots below inside the house and outside The yard seemed
to be full of men Something was being dragged across the stones The womans
singing had stopped abruptly There was a long rolling clang as though the
washtub had been ung across the yard and then a confusion of angry shouts
which ended in a yell of pain
The house is surrounded said Winston
The house is surrounded said the voice
He heard Julia snap her teeth together I suppose we may as well say
goodbye she said
You may as well say goodbye said the voice And then another quite
dierent voice a thin cultivated voice which Winston had the impression of
having heard before struck in And by the way while we are on the subject
Here comes a candle to light you to bed here comes a chopper to chop o your
head
Something crashed on to the bed behind Winstons back The head of a
ladder had been thrust through the window and had burst in the frame Some
one was climbing through the window There was a stampede of boots up the
stairs The room was full of solid men in black uniforms with ironshod boots
on their feet and truncheons in their hands
Winston was not trembling any longer Even his eyes he barely moved One
thing alone mattered to keep still to keep still and not give them an excuse
to hit you A man with a smooth prizeghters jowl in which the mouth was
only a slit paused opposite him balancing his truncheon meditatively between
thumb and forenger Winston met his eyes The feeling of nakedness with
ones hands behind ones head and ones face and body all exposed was almost
unbearable The man protruded the tip of a white tongue licked the place
where his lips should have been and then passed on There was another crash
Someone had picked up the glass paperweight from the table and smashed it to
pieces on the hearthstone
The fragment of coral a tiny crinkle of pink like a sugar rosebud from a cake
rolled across the mat How small thought Winston how small it always was
There was a gasp and a thump behind him and he received a violent kick on
the ankle which nearly ung him o his balance One of the men had smashed
his st into Julias solar plexus doubling her up like a pocket ruler She was
thrashing about on the oor ghting for breath Winston dared not turn his
head even by a millimetre but sometimes her livid gasping face came within
the angle of his vision Even in his terror it was as though he could feel the pain
in his own body the deadly pain which nevertheless was less urgent than the
struggle to get back her breath He knew what it was like the terrible agonizing
pain which was there all the while but could not be suered yet because before
all else it was necessary to be able to breathe Then two of the men hoisted

===== Page 131 =====
her up by knees and shoulders and carried her out of the room like a sack
Winston had a glimpse of her face upside down yellow and contorted with the
eyes shut and still with a smear of rouge on either cheek and that was the last
he saw of her
He stood dead still No one had hit him yet Thoughts which came of their
own accord but seemed totally uninteresting began to it through his mind He
wondered whether they had got Mr Charrington He wondered what they had
done to the woman in the yard He noticed that he badly wanted to urinate
and felt a faint surprise because he had done so only two or three hours ago
He noticed that the clock on the mantelpiece said nine meaning twentyone
But the light seemed too strong Would not the light be fading at twentyone
hours on an August evening He wondered whether after all he and Julia had
mistaken the time  had slept the clock round and thought it was twentythirty
when really it was nought eightthirty on the following morning But he did not
pursue the thought further It was not interesting
There ws another lighter step in the passage Mr Charrington came into
the room The demeanour of the blackuniformed men suddenly became more
subdued Something had also changed in Mr Charringtons appearance His
eye fell on the fragments of the glass paperweight
Pick up those pieces he said sharply
A man stooped to obey The cockney accent had disappeared Winston
suddenly realized whose voice it was that he had heard a few moments ago on
the telescreen Mr Charrington was still wearing his old velvet jacket but his
hair which had been almost white had turned black Also he was not wearing
his spectacles He gave Winston a single sharp glance as though verifying his
identity and then paid no more attention to him He was still recognizable
but he was not the same person any longer His body had straightened and
seemed to have grown bigger His face had undergone only tiny changes that
had nevertheless worked a complete transformation The black eyebrows were
less bushy the wrinkles were gone the whole lines of the face seemed to have
altered even the nose seemed shorter It was the alert cold face of a man of
about veandthirty It occurred to Winston that for the rst time in his life
he was looking with knowledge at a member of the Thought Police

Chapter 
He did not know where he was Presumably he was in the Ministry of Love
but there was no way of making certain He was in a highceilinged windowless
cell with walls of glittering white porcelain Concealed lamps ooded it with
cold light and there was a low steady humming sound which he supposed had
something to do with the air supply A bench or shelf just wide enough to sit
on ran round the wall broken only by the door and at the end opposite the
door a lavatory pan with no wooden seat There were four telescreens one in
each wall
There was a dull aching in his belly It had been there ever since they had
bundled him into the closed van and driven him away But he was also hungry
with a gnawing unwholesome kind of hunger It might be twentyfour hours
since he had eaten it might be thirtysix He still did not know probably never
would know whether it had been morning or evening when they arrested him
Since he was arrested he had not been fed
He sat as still as he could on the narrow bench with his hands crossed on his
knee He had already learned to sit still If you made unexpected movements
they yelled at you from the telescreen But the craving for food was growing
upon him What he longed for above all was a piece of bread He had an idea
that there were a few breadcrumbs in the pocket of his overalls It was even
possible  he thought this because from time to time something seemed to
tickle his leg  that there might be a sizeable bit of crust there In the end the
temptation to nd out overcame his fear he slipped a hand into his pocket
Smith yelled a voice from the telescreen  Smith W Hands out of
pockets in the cells
He sat still again his hands crossed on his knee Before being brought here
he had been taken to another place which must have been an ordinary prison
or a temporary lockup used by the patrols He did not know how long he
had been there some hours at any rate with no clocks and no daylight it was
hard to gauge the time It was a noisy evilsmelling place They had put him
into a cell similar to the one he was now in but lthily dirty and at all times
crowded by ten or fteen people The majority of them were common criminals
but there were a few political prisoners among them He had sat silent against
the wall jostled by dirty bodies too preoccupied by fear and the pain in his
belly to take much interest in his surroundings but still noticing the astonishing
dierence in demeanour between the Party prisoners and the others The Party
prisoners were always silent and terried but the ordinary criminals seemed
to care nothing for anybody They yelled insults at the guards fought back

===== Page 133 =====
ercely when their belongings were impounded wrote obscene words on the
oor ate smuggled food which they produced from mysterious hidingplaces in
their clothes and even shouted down the telescreen when it tried to restore
order On the other hand some of them seemed to be on good terms with
the guards called them by nicknames and tried to wheedle cigarettes through
the spyhole in the door The guards too treated the common criminals with
a certain forbearance even when they had to handle them roughly There
was much talk about the forcedlabour camps to which most of the prisoners
expected to be sent It was all right in the camps he gathered so long as you
had good contacts and knew the ropes There was bribery favouritism and
racketeering of every kind there was homosexuality and prostitution there was
even illicit alcohol distilled from potatoes The positions of trust were given
only to the common criminals especially the gangsters and the murderers who
formed a sort of aristocracy All the dirty jobs were done by the politicals
There was a constant comeandgo of prisoners of every description drug
peddlers thieves bandits blackmarketeers drunks prostitutes Some of the
drunks were so violent that the other prisoners had to combine to suppress
them An enormous wreck of a woman aged about sixty with great tumbling
breasts and thick coils of white hair which had come down in her struggles
was carried in kicking and shouting by four guards who had hold of her one
at each corner They wrenched o the boots with which she had been trying
to kick them and dumped her down across Winstons lap almost breaking his
thighbones The woman hoisted herself upright and followed them out with a
yell of F bastards Then noticing that she was sitting on something uneven
she slid o Winstons knees on to the bench
Beg pardon dearie she said I wouldnt a sat on you only the buggers
put me there They dono ow to treat a lady do they She paused patted her
breast and belched Pardon she said I aint meself quite
She leant forward and vomited copiously on the oor
Thass better she said leaning back with closed eyes Never keep it down
thass what I say Get it up while its fresh on your stomach like
She revived turned to have another look at Winston and seemed immedi
ately to take a fancy to him She put a vast arm round his shoulder and drew
him towards her breathing beer and vomit into his face
Wass your name dearie she said
Smith said Winston
Smith said the woman Thass funny My names Smith too Why she
added sentimentally I might be your mother
She might thought Winston be his mother She was about the right age
and physique and it was probable that people changed somewhat after twenty
years in a forcedlabour camp
No one else had spoken to him To a surprising extent the ordinary criminals
ignored the Party prisoners The polits they called them with a sort of
uninterested contempt The Party prisoners seemed terried of speaking to
anybody and above all of speaking to one another Only once when two Party
members both women were pressed close together on the bench he overheard
amid the din of voices a few hurriedlywhispered words and in particular a
reference to something called room oneohone which he did not understand
It might be two or three hours ago that they had brought him here The dull
pain in his belly never went away but sometimes it grew better and sometimes

===== Page 134 =====
worse and his thoughts expanded or contracted accordingly When it grew
worse he thought only of the pain itself and of his desire for food When it
grew better panic took hold of him There were moments when he foresaw the
things that would happen to him with such actuality that his heart galloped
and his breath stopped He felt the smash of truncheons on his elbows and
ironshod boots on his shins he saw himself grovelling on the oor screaming
for mercy through broken teeth He hardly thought of Julia He could not x
his mind on her He loved her and would not betray her but that was only
a fact known as he knew the rules of arithmetic He felt no love for her and
he hardly even wondered what was happening to her He thought oftener of
OBrien with a ickering hope OBrien might know that he had been arrested
The Brotherhood he had said never tried to save its members But there was
the razor blade they would send the razor blade if they could There would
be perhaps ve seconds before the guard could rush into the cell The blade
would bite into him with a sort of burning coldness and even the ngers that
held it would be cut to the bone Everything came back to his sick body which
shrank trembling from the smallest pain He was not certain that he would use
the razor blade even if he got the chance It was more natural to exist from
moment to moment accepting another ten minutes life even with the certainty
that there was torture at the end of it
Sometimes he tried to calculate the number of porcelain bricks in the walls
of the cell It should have been easy but he always lost count at some point
or another More often he wondered where he was and what time of day it
was At one moment he felt certain that it was broad daylight outside and
at the next equally certain that it was pitch darkness In this place he knew
instinctively the lights would never be turned out It was the place with no
darkness he saw now why OBrien had seemed to recognize the allusion In
the Ministry of Love there were no windows His cell might be at the heart of
the building or against its outer wall it might be ten oors below ground or
thirty above it He moved himself mentally from place to place and tried to
determine by the feeling of his body whether he was perched high in the air or
buried deep underground
There was a sound of marching boots outside The steel door opened with a
clang A young ocer a trim blackuniformed gure who seemed to glitter all
over with polished leather and whose pale straightfeatured face was like a wax
mask stepped smartly through the doorway He motioned to the guards outside
to bring in the prisoner they were leading The poet Ampleforth shambled into
the cell The door clanged shut again
Ampleforth made one or two uncertain movements from side to side as
though having some idea that there was another door to go out of and then
began to wander up and down the cell He had not yet noticed Winstons
presence His troubled eyes were gazing at the wall about a metre above the
level of Winstons head He was shoeless large dirty toes were sticking out of
the holes in his socks He was also several days away from a shave A scrubby
beard covered his face to the cheekbones giving him an air of ruanism that
went oddly with his large weak frame and nervous movements
Winston roused hirnself a little from his lethargy He must speak to Am
pleforth and risk the yell from the telescreen It was even conceivable that
Ampleforth was the bearer of the razor blade
Ampleforth he said

===== Page 135 =====
There was no yell from the telescreen Ampleforth paused mildly startled
His eyes focused themselves slowly on Winston
Ah Smith he said You too
What are you in for
To tell you the truth   He sat down awkwardly on the bench opposite
Winston There is only one oence is there not he said
And have you committed it
Apparently I have
He put a hand to his forehead and pressed his temples for a moment as
though trying to remember something
These things happen he began vaguely I have been able to recall one
instance  a possible instance It was an indiscretion undoubtedly We were
producing a denitive edition of the poems of Kipling I allowed the word God
to remain at the end of a line I could not help it he added almost indignantly
raising his face to look at Winston It was impossible to change the line The
rhyme was rod Do you realize that there are only twelve rhymes to rod
in the entire language For days I had racked my brains There was no other
rhyme
The expression on his face changed The annoyance passed out of it and for
a moment he looked almost pleased A sort of intellectual warmth the joy of
the pedant who has found out some useless fact shone through the dirt and
scrubby hair
Has it ever occurred to you he said that the whole history of English
poetry has been determined by the fact that the English language lacks rhymes
No that particular thought had never occurred to Winston Nor in the
circumstances did it strike him as very important or interesting
Do you know what time of day it is he said
Ampleforth looked startled again I had hardly thought about it They
arrested me  it could be two days ago  perhaps three His eyes itted round
the walls as though he half expected to nd a window somewhere There is
no dierence between night and day in this place I do not see how one can
calculate the time
They talked desultorily for some minutes then without apparent reason
a yell from the telescreen bade them be silent Winston sat quietly his hands
crossed Ampleforth too large to sit in comfort on the narrow bench dgeted
from side to side clasping his lank hands rst round one knee then round
the other The telescreen barked at him to keep still Time passed Twenty
minutes an hour  it was dicult to judge Once more there was a sound of
boots outside Winstons entrails contracted Soon very soon perhaps in ve
minutes perhaps now the tramp of boots would mean that his own turn had
come
The door opened The coldfaced young ocer stepped into the cell With
a brief movement of the hand he indicated Ampleforth
Room  he said
Ampleforth marched clumsily out between the guards his face vaguely per
turbed but uncomprehending
What seemed like a long time passed The pain in Winstons belly had
revived His mind sagged round and round on the same trick like a ball falling
again and again into the same series of slots He had only six thoughts The
pain in his belly a piece of bread the blood and the screaming OBrien  Julia

the razor blade There was another spasm in his entrails the heavy boots were
approaching As the door opened the wave of air that it created brought in
a powerful smell of cold sweat Parsons walked into the cell He was wearing
khaki shorts and a sportsshirt
This time Winston was startled into selfforgetfulness
You here he said
Parsons gave Winston a glance in which there was neither interest nor sur
prise but only misery He began walking jerkily up and down evidently unable
to keep still Each time he straightened his pudgy knees it was apparent that
they were trembling His eyes had a wideopen staring look as though he could
not prevent himself from gazing at something in the middle distance
What are you in for said Winston
Thoughtcrime said Parsons almost blubbering The tone of his voice
implied at once a complete admission of his guilt and a sort of incredulous horror
that such a word could be applied to himself He paused opposite Winston and
began eagerly appealing to him You dont think theyll shoot me do you
old chap They dont shoot you if you havent actually done anything  only
thoughts which you cant help I know they give you a fair hearing Oh I
trust them for that Theyll know my record wont they You know what kind
of chap I was Not a bad chap in my way Not brainy of course but keen I
tried to do my best for the Party didnt I Ill get o with ve years dont you
think Or even ten years A chap like me could make himself pretty useful in
a labourcamp They wouldnt shoot me for going o the rails just once
Are you guilty said Winston
Of course Im guilty cried Parsons with a servile glance at the telescreen
You dont think the Party would arrest an innocent man do you His frog
like face grew calmer and even took on a slightly sanctimonious expression
Thoughtcrime is a dreadful thing old man he said sententiously Its insid
ious It can get hold of you without your even knowing it Do you know how
it got hold of me In my sleep Yes thats a fact There I was working away
trying to do my bit  never knew I had any bad stu in my mind at all And
then I started talking in my sleep Do you know what they heard me saying
He sank his voice like someone who is obliged for medical reasons to utter
an obscenity
Down with Big Brother Yes I said that Said it over and over again it
seems Between you and me old man Im glad they got me before it went any
further Do you know what Im going to say to them when I go up before the
tribunal Thank you Im going to say thank you for saving me before it
was too late
Who denounced you said Winston
It was my little daughter said Parsons with a sort of doleful pride She
listened at the keyhole Heard what I was saying and nipped o to the patrols
the very next day Pretty smart for a nipper of seven eh I dont bear her any
grudge for it In fact Im proud of her It shows I brought her up in the right
spirit anyway
He made a few more jerky movements up and down several times casting
a longing glance at the lavatory pan Then he suddenly ripped down his shorts
Excuse me old man he said I cant help it Its the waiting
He plumped his large posterior into the lavatory pan Winston covered his
face with his hands

===== Page 137 =====
Smith yelled the voice from the telescreen  Smith W Uncover your
face No faces covered in the cells
Winston uncovered his face Parsons used the lavatory loudly and abun
dantly It then turned out that the plug was defective and the cell stank abom
inably for hours afterwards
Parsons was removed More prisoners came and went mysteriously One a
woman was consigned to Room  and Winston noticed seemed to shrivel
and turn a dierent colour when she heard the words A time came when if
it had been morning when he was brought here it would be afternoon or if
it had been afternoon then it would be midnight There were six prisoners in
the cell men and women All sat very still Opposite Winston there sat a man
with a chinless toothy face exactly like that of some large harmless rodent
His fat mottled cheeks were so pouched at the bottom that it was dicult not
to believe that he had little stores of food tucked away there His palegrey
eyes itted timorously from face to face and turned quickly away again when
he caught anyones eye
The door opened and another prisoner was brought in whose appearance
sent a momentary chill through Winston He was a commonplace meanlooking
man who might have been an engineer or technician of some kind But what
was startling was the emaciation of his face It was like a skull Because of
its thinness the mouth and eyes looked disproportionately large and the eyes
seemed lled with a murderous unappeasable hatred of somebody or something
The man sat down on the bench at a little distance from Winston Winston
did not look at him again but the tormented skulllike face was as vivid in his
mind as though it had been straight in front of his eyes Suddenly he realized
what was the matter The man was dying of starvation The same thought
seemed to occur almost simultaneously to everyone in the cell There was a
very faint stirring all the way round the bench The eyes of the chinless man
kept itting towards the skullfaced man then turning guiltily away then being
dragged back by an irresistible attraction Presently he began to dget on his
seat At last he stood up waddled clumsily across the cell dug down into the
pocket of his overalls and with an abashed air held out a grimy piece of bread
to the skull faced man
There was a furious deafening roar from the telescreen The chinless man
jumped in his tracks The skullfaced man had quickly thrust his hands behind
his back as though demonstrating to all the world that he refused the gift
Bumstead roared the voice  Bumstead J Let fall that piece of
bread
The chinless man dropped the piece of bread on the oor
Remain standing where you are said the voice Face the door Make no
movement
The chinless man obeyed His large pouchy cheeks were quivering uncontrol
lably The door clanged open As the young ocer entered and stepped aside
there emerged from behind him a short stumpy guard with enormous arms and
shoulders He took his stand opposite the chinless man and then at a signal
from the ocer let free a frightful blow with all the weight of his body behind
it full in the chinless mans mouth The force of it seemed almost to knock him
clear of the oor His body was ung across the cell and fetched up against the
base of the lavatory seat For a moment he lay as though stunned with dark
blood oozing from his mouth and nose A very faint whimpering or squeaking

===== Page 138 =====
which seemed unconscious came out of him Then he rolled over and raised
himself unsteadily on hands and knees Amid a stream of blood and saliva the
two halves of a dental plate fell out of his mouth
The prisoners sat very still their hands crossed on their knees The chin
less man climbed back into his place Down one side of his face the esh was
darkening His mouth had swollen into a shapeless cherrycoloured mass with a
black hole in the middle of it
From time to time a little blood dripped on to the breast of his overalls His
grey eyes still itted from face to face more guiltily than ever as though he
were trying to discover how much the others despised him for his humiliation
The door opened With a small gesture the ocer indicated the skullfaced
man
Room  he said
There was a gasp and a urry at Winstons side The man had actually
ung himself on his knees on the oor with his hand clasped together
Comrade Ocer he cried You dont have to take me to that place
Havent I told you everything already What else is it you want to know
Theres nothing I wouldnt confess nothing Just tell me what it is and Ill
confess straight o Write it down and Ill sign it  anything Not room 
Room  said the ocer
The mans face already very pale turned a colour Winston would not have
believed possible It was denitely unmistakably a shade of green
Do anything to me he yelled Youve been starving me for weeks Finish
it o and let me die Shoot me Hang me Sentence me to twentyve years Is
there somebody else you want me to give away Just say who it is and Ill tell
you anything you want I dont care who it is or what you do to them Ive got
a wife and three children The biggest of them isnt six years old You can take
the whole lot of them and cut their throats in front of my eyes and Ill stand
by and watch it But not Room 
Room  said the ocer
The man looked frantically round at the other prisoners as though with
some idea that he could put another victim in his own place His eyes settled
on the smashed face of the chinless man He ung out a lean arm
Thats the one you ought to be taking not me he shouted You didnt
hear what he was saying after they bashed his face Give me a chance and Ill
tell you every word of it Hes the one thats against the Party not me The
guards stepped forward The mans voice rose to a shriek You didnt hear
him he repeated Something went wrong with the telescreen Hes the one
you want Take him not me
The two sturdy guards had stooped to take him by the arms But just at
this moment he ung himself across the oor of the cell and grabbed one of the
iron legs that supported the bench He had set up a wordless howling like an
animal The guards took hold of him to wrench him loose but he clung on with
astonishing strength For perhaps twenty seconds they were hauling at him
The prisoners sat quiet their hands crossed on their knees looking straight in
front of them The howling stopped the man had no breath left for anything
except hanging on Then there was a dierent kind of cry A kick from a guards
boot had broken the ngers of one of his hands They dragged him to his feet
Room  said the ocer

===== Page 139 =====
The man was led out walking unsteadily with head sunken nursing his
crushed hand all the ght had gone out of him
A long time passed If it had been midnight when the skullfaced man was
taken away it was morning if morning it was afternoon Winston was alone
and had been alone for hours The pain of sitting on the narrow bench was such
that often he got up and walked about unreproved by the telescreen The piece
of bread still lay where the chinless man had dropped it At the beginning it
needed a hard eort not to look at it but presently hunger gave way to thirst
His mouth was sticky and eviltasting The humming sound and the unvarying
white light induced a sort of faintness an empty feeling inside his head He
would get up because the ache in his bones was no longer bearable and then
would sit down again almost at once because he was too dizzy to make sure of
staying on his feet Whenever his physical sensations were a little under control
the terror returned Sometimes with a fading hope he thought of OBrien and
the razor blade It was thinkable that the razor blade might arrive concealed
in his food if he were ever fed More dimly he thought of Julia Somewhere or
other she was suering perhaps far worse than he She might be screaming with
pain at this moment He thought If I could save Julia by doubling my own
pain would I do it Yes I would But that was merely an intellectual decision
taken because he knew that he ought to take it He did not feel it In this place
you could not feel anything except pain and foreknowledge of pain Besides
was it possible when you were actually suering it to wish for any reason that
your own pain should increase But that question was not answerable yet
The boots were approaching again The door opened OBrien came in
Winston started to his feet The shock of the sight had driven all caution out
of him For the rst time in many years he forgot the presence of the telescreen
Theyve got you too he cried
They got me a long time ago said OBrien with a mild almost regretful
irony He stepped aside from behind him there emerged a broadchested guard
with a long black truncheon in his hand
You know him Winston said OBrien Dont deceive yourself You did
know it  you have always known it
Yes he saw now he had always known it But there was no time to think of
that All he had eyes for was the truncheon in the guards hand It might fall
anywhere on the crown on the tip of the ear on the upper arm on the elbow
The elbow He had slumped to his knees almost paralysed clasping the
stricken elbow with his other hand Everything had exploded into yellow light
Inconceivable inconceivable that one blow could cause such pain The light
cleared and he could see the other two looking down at him The guard was
laughing at his contortions One question at any rate was answered Never for
any reason on earth could you wish for an increase of pain Of pain you could
wish only one thing that it should stop Nothing in the world was so bad as
physical pain In the face of pain there are no heroes no heroes he thought
over and over as he writhed on the oor clutching uselessly at his disabled left
arm

Chapter 
He was lying on something that felt like a camp bed except that it was higher
o the ground and that he was xed down in some way so that he could not
move Light that seemed stronger than usual was falling on his face OBrien
was standing at his side looking down at him intently At the other side of him
stood a man in a white coat holding a hypodermic syringe
Even after his eyes were open he took in his surroundings only gradually
He had the impression of swimming up into this room from some quite dierent
world a sort of underwater world far beneath it How long he had been down
there he did not know Since the moment when they arrested him he had not
seen darkness or daylight Besides his memories were not continuous There
had been times when consciousness even the sort of consciousness that one
has in sleep had stopped dead and started again after a blank interval But
whether the intervals were of days or weeks or only seconds there was no way
of knowing
With that rst blow on the elbow the nightmare had started Later he
was to realize that all that then happened was merely a preliminary a routine
interrogation to which nearly all prisoners were subjected There was a long
range of crimes  espionage sabotage and the like  to which everyone had
to confess as a matter of course The confession was a formality though the
torture was real How many times he had been beaten how long the beatings
had continued he could not remember Always there were ve or six men in
black uniforms at him simultaneously Sometimes it was sts sometimes it was
truncheons sometimes it was steel rods sometimes it was boots There were
times when he rolled about the oor as shameless as an animal writhing his
body this way and that in an endless hopeless eort to dodge the kicks and
simply inviting more and yet more kicks in his ribs in his belly on his elbows
on his shins in his groin in his testicles on the bone at the base of his spine
There were times when it went on and on until the cruel wicked unforgivable
thing seemed to him not that the guards continued to beat him but that he
could not force hirnself into losing consciousness There were times when his
nerve so forsook him that he began shouting for mercy even before the beating
began when the mere sight of a st drawn back for a blow was enough to make
him pour forth a confession of real and imaginary crimes There were other
times when he started out with the resolve of confessing nothing when every
word had to be forced out of him between gasps of pain and there were times
when he feebly tried to compromise when he said to himself I will confess but
not yet I must hold out till the pain becomes unbearable Three more kicks

===== Page 141 =====
two more kicks and then I will tell them what they want Sometimes he was
beaten till he could hardly stand then ung like a sack of potatoes on to the
stone oor of a cell left to recuperate for a few hours and then taken out and
beaten again There were also longer periods of recovery He remembered them
dimly because they were spent chiey in sleep or stupor He remembered a cell
with a plank bed a sort of shelf sticking out from the wall and a tin wash
basin and meals of hot soup and bread and sometimes coee He remembered
a surly barber arriving to scrape his chin and crop his hair and businesslike
unsympathetic men in white coats feeling his pulse tapping his reexes turning
up his eyelids running harsh ngers over him in search for broken bones and
shooting needles into his arm to make him sleep
The beatings grew less frequent and became mainly a threat a horror to
which he could be sent back at any moment when his answers were unsatis
factory His questioners now were not ruans in black uniforms but Party
intellectuals little rotund men with quick movements and ashing spectacles
who worked on him in relays over periods which lasted  he thought he could
not be sure  ten or twelve hours at a stretch These other questioners saw
to it that he was in constant slight pain but it was not chiey pain that they
relied on They slapped his face wrung his ears pulled his hair made him
stand on one leg refused him leave to urinate shone glaring lights in his face
until his eyes ran with water but the aim of this was simply to humiliate him
and destroy his power of arguing and reasoning Their real weapon was the
merciless questioning that went on and on hour after hour tripping him up
laying traps for him twisting everything that he said convicting him at every
step of lies and selfcontradiction until he began weeping as much from shame
as from nervous fatigue Sometimes he would weep half a dozen times in a single
session Most of the time they screamed abuse at him and threatened at every
hesitation to deliver him over to the guards again but sometimes they would
suddenly change their tune call him comrade appeal to him in the name of
Ingsoc and Big Brother and ask him sorrowfully whether even now he had not
enough loyalty to the Party left to make him wish to undo the evil he had done
When his nerves were in rags after hours of questioning even this appeal could
reduce him to snivelling tears In the end the nagging voices broke him down
more completely than the boots and sts of the guards He became simply a
mouth that uttered a hand that signed whatever was demanded of him His
sole concern was to nd out what they wanted him to confess and then confess
it quickly before the bullying started anew He confessed to the assassination of
eminent Party members the distribution of seditious pamphlets embezzlement
of public funds sale of military secrets sabotage of every kind He confessed
that he had been a spy in the pay of the Eastasian government as far back as
 He confessed that he was a religious believer an admirer of capitalism
and a sexual pervert He confessed that he had murdered his wife although
he knew and his questioners must have known that his wife was still alive
He confessed that for years he had been in personal touch with Goldstein and
had been a member of an underground organization which had included almost
every human being he had ever known It was easier to confess everything and
implicate everybody Besides in a sense it was all true It was true that he
had been the enemy of the Party and in the eyes of the Party there was no
distinction between the thought and the deed
There were also memories of another kind They stood out in his mind

===== Page 142 =====
disconnectedly like pictures with blackness all round them
He was in a cell which might have been either dark or light because he could
see nothing except a pair of eyes Near at hand some kind of instrument was
ticking slowly and regularly The eyes grew larger and more luminous Suddenly
he oated out of his seat dived into the eyes and was swallowed up
He was strapped into a chair surrounded by dials under dazzling lights A
man in a white coat was reading the dials There was a tramp of heavy boots
outside The door clanged open The waxedfaced ocer marched in followed
by two guards
Room  said the ocer
The man in the white coat did not turn round He did not look at Winston
either he was looking only at the dials
He was rolling down a mighty corridor a kilometre wide full of glorious
golden light roaring with laughter and shouting out confessions at the top of
his voice He was confessing everything even the things he had succeeded in
holding back under the torture He was relating the entire history of his life
to an audience who knew it already With him were the guards the other
questioners the men in white coats OBrien Julia Mr Charrington all rolling
down the corridor together and shouting with laughter Some dreadful thing
which had lain embedded in the future had somehow been skipped over and had
not happened Everything was all right there was no more pain the last detail
of his life was laid bare understood forgiven
He was starting up from the plank bed in the halfcertainty that he had
heard OBriens voice All through his interrogation although he had never
seen him he had had the feeling that OBrien was at his elbow just out of
sight It was OBrien who was directing everything It was he who set the
guards on to Winston and who prevented them from killing him It was he
who decided when Winston should scream with pain when he should have a
respite when he should be fed when he should sleep when the drugs should
be pumped into his arm It was he who asked the questions and suggested the
answers He was the tormentor he was the protector he was the inquisitor
he was the friend And once  Winston could not remember whether it was
in drugged sleep or in normal sleep or even in a moment of wakefulness  a
voice murmured in his ear Dont worry Winston you are in my keeping For
seven years I have watched over you Now the turningpoint has come I shall
save you I shall make you perfect He was not sure whether it was OBriens
voice but it was the same voice that had said to him We shall meet in the
place where there is no darkness in that other dream seven years ago
He did not remember any ending to his interrogation There was a period
of blackness and then the cell or room in which he now was had gradually
materialized round him He was almost at on his back and unable to move
His body was held down at every essential point Even the back of his head
was gripped in some manner OBrien was looking down at him gravely and
rather sadly His face seen from below looked coarse and worn with pouches
under the eyes and tired lines from nose to chin He was older than Winston
had thought him he was perhaps fortyeight or fty Under his hand there was
a dial with a lever on top and gures running round the face
I told you said OBrien that if we met again it would be here
Yes said Winston
Without any warning except a slight movement of OBriens hand a wave of

===== Page 143 =====
pain ooded his body It was a frightening pain because he could not see what
was happening and he had the feeling that some mortal injury was being done
to him He did not know whether the thing was really happening or whether
the eect was electrically produced but his body was being wrenched out of
shape the joints were being slowly torn apart Although the pain had brought
the sweat out on his forehead the worst of all was the fear that his backbone
was about to snap He set his teeth and breathed hard through his nose trying
to keep silent as long as possible
You are afraid said OBrien watching his face that in another moment
something is going to break Your especial fear is that it will be your backbone
You have a vivid mental picture of the vertebrae snapping apart and the spinal
uid dripping out of them That is what you are thinking is it not Winston
Winston did not answer OBrien drew back the lever on the dial The wave
of pain receded almost as quickly as it had come
That was forty said OBrien You can see that the numbers on this dial
run up to a hundred Will you please remember throughout our conversation
that I have it in my power to inict pain on you at any moment and to whatever
degree I choose If you tell me any lies or attempt to prevaricate in any way
or even fall below your usual level of intelligence you will cry out with pain
instantly Do you understand that
Yes said Winston
OBriens manner became less severe He resettled his spectacles thought
fully and took a pace or two up and down When he spoke his voice was gentle
and patient He had the air of a doctor a teacher even a priest anxious to
explain and persuade rather than to punish
I am taking trouble with you Winston he said because you are worth
trouble You know perfectly well what is the matter with you You have known
it for years though you have fought against the knowledge You are mentally
deranged You suer from a defective memory You are unable to remember
real events and you persuade yourself that you remember other events which
never happened Fortunately it is curable You have never cured yourself of it
because you did not choose to There was a small eort of the will that you
were not ready to make Even now I am well aware you are clinging to your
disease under the impression that it is a virtue Now we will take an example
At this moment which power is Oceania at war with
When I was arrested Oceania was at war with Eastasia
With Eastasia Good And Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia
has it not
Winston drew in his breath He opened his mouth to speak and then did
not speak He could not take his eyes away from the dial
The truth please Winston Your truth Tell me what you think you
remember
I remember that until only a week before I was arrested we were not at
war with Eastasia at all We were in alliance with them The war was against
Eurasia That had lasted for four years Before that  
OBrien stopped him with a movement of the hand
Another example he said Some years ago you had a very serious delusion
indeed You believed that three men three onetime Party members named
Jones Aaronson and Rutherford men who were executed for treachery and
sabotage after making the fullest possible confession  were not guilty of the

===== Page 144 =====
crimes they were charged with You believed that you had seen unmistakable
documentary evidence proving that their confessions were false There was a
certain photograph about which you had a hallucination You believed that you
had actually held it in your hands It was a photograph something like this
An oblong slip of newspaper had appeared between OBriens ngers For
perhaps ve seconds it was within the angle of Winstons vision It was a
photograph and there was no question of its identity It was the photograph
It was another copy of the photograph of Jones Aaronson and Rutherford at
the party function in New York which he had chanced upon eleven years ago
and promptly destroyed For only an instant it was before his eyes then it was
out of sight again But he had seen it unquestionably he had seen it He made
a desperate agonizing eort to wrench the top half of his body free It was
impossible to move so much as a centimetre in any direction For the moment
he had even forgotten the dial All he wanted was to hold the photograph in
his ngers again or at least to see it
It exists he cried
No said OBrien
He stepped across the room There was a memory hole in the opposite wall
OBrien lifted the grating Unseen the frail slip of paper was whirling away on
the current of warm air it was vanishing in a ash of ame OBrien turned
away from the wall
Ashes he said Not even identiable ashes Dust It does not exist It
never existed
But it did exist It does exist It exists in memory I remember it You
remember it
I do not remember it said OBrien
Winstons heart sank That was doublethink He had a feeling of deadly
helplessness If he could have been certain that OBrien was lying it would not
have seemed to matter But it was perfectly possible that OBrien had really
forgotten the photograph And if so then already he would have forgotten his
denial of remembering it and forgotten the act of forgetting How could one be
sure that it was simple trickery Perhaps that lunatic dislocation in the mind
could really happen that was the thought that defeated him
OBrien was looking down at him speculatively More than ever he had the
air of a teacher taking pains with a wayward but promising child
There is a Party slogan dealing with the control of the past he said Repeat
it if you please
Who controls the past controls the future who controls the present controls
the past repeated Winston obediently
Who controls the present controls the past said OBrien nodding his
head with slow approval Is it your opinion Winston that the past has real
existence
Again the feeling of helplessness descended upon Winston His eyes itted
towards the dial He not only did not know whether yes or no was the answer
that would save him from pain he did not even know which answer he believed
to be the true one
OBrien smiled faintly You are no metaphysician Winston he said Until
this moment you had never considered what is meant by existence I will put it
more precisely Does the past exist concretely in space Is there somewhere or
other a place a world of solid objects where the past is still happening

===== Page 145 =====
No
Then where does the past exist if at all
In records It is written down
In records And 
In the mind In human memories
In memory Very well then We the Party control all records and we
control all memories Then we control the past do we not
But how can you stop people remembering things cried Winston again
momentarily forgetting the dial It is involuntary It is outside oneself How
can you control memory You have not controlled mine
OBriens manner grew stern again He laid his hand on the dial
On the contrary he said you have not controlled it That is what has
brought you here You are here because you have failed in humility in self
discipline You would not make the act of submission which is the price of
sanity You preferred to be a lunatic a minority of one Only the disciplined
mind can see reality Winston You believe that reality is something objective
external existing in its own right You also believe that the nature of reality
is selfevident When you delude yourself into thinking that you see something
you assume that everyone else sees the same thing as you But I tell you
Winston that reality is not external Reality exists in the human mind and
nowhere else Not in the individual mind which can make mistakes and in
any case soon perishes only in the mind of the Party which is collective and
immortal Whatever the Party holds to be the truth is truth It is impossible
to see reality except by looking through the eyes of the Party That is the fact
that you have got to relearn Winston It needs an act of selfdestruction an
eort of the will You must humble yourself before you can become sane
He paused for a few moments as though to allow what he had been saying
to sink in
Do you remember he went on  writing in your diary Freedom is the
freedom to say that two plus two make four
Yes said Winston
OBrien held up his left hand its back towards Winston with the thumb
hidden and the four ngers extended
How many ngers am I holding up Winston
Four
And if the party says that it is not four but ve  then how many
Four
The word ended in a gasp of pain The needle of the dial had shot up to
ftyve The sweat had sprung out all over Winstons body The air tore into
his lungs and issued again in deep groans which even by clenching his teeth he
could not stop OBrien watched him the four ngers still extended He drew
back the lever This time the pain was only slightly eased
How many ngers Winston
Four
The needle went up to sixty
How many ngers Winston
Four Four What else can I say Four
The needle must have risen again but he did not look at it The heavy stern
face and the four ngers lled his vision The ngers stood up before his eyes
like pillars enormous blurry and seeming to vibrate but unmistakably four

===== Page 146 =====
How many ngers Winston
Four Stop it stop it How can you go on Four Four
How many ngers Winston
Five Five Five
No Winston that is no use You are lying You still think there are four
How many ngers please
Four ve Four Anything you like Only stop it stop the pain
Abruptly he was sitting up with OBriens arm round his shoulders He
had perhaps lost consciousness for a few seconds The bonds that had held his
body down were loosened He felt very cold he was shaking uncontrollably his
teeth were chattering the tears were rolling down his cheeks For a moment
he clung to OBrien like a baby curiously comforted by the heavy arm round
his shoulders He had the feeling that OBrien was his protector that the pain
was something that came from outside from some other source and that it was
OBrien who would save him from it
You are a slow learner Winston said OBrien gently
How can I help it he blubbered How can I help seeing what is in front
of my eyes Two and two are four
Sometimes Winston Sometimes they are ve Sometimes they are three
Sometimes they are all of them at once You must try harder It is not easy to
become sane
He laid Winston down on the bed The grip of his limbs tightened again but
the pain had ebbed away and the trembling had stopped leaving him merely
weak and cold OBrien motioned with his head to the man in the white coat
who had stood immobile throughout the proceedings The man in the white
coat bent down and looked closely into Winstons eyes felt his pulse laid an
ear against his chest tapped here and there then he nodded to OBrien
Again said OBrien
The pain owed into Winstons body The needle must be at seventy
seventyve He had shut his eyes this time He knew that the ngers were
still there and still four All that mattered was somehow to stay alive until the
spasm was over He had ceased to notice whether he was crying out or not The
pain lessened again He opened his eyes OBrien had drawn back the lever
How many ngers Winston
Four I suppose there are four I would see ve if I could I am trying to
see ve
Which do you wish to persuade me that you see ve or really to see them
Really to see them
Again said OBrien
Perhaps the needle was eighty  ninety Winston could not intermittently
remember why the pain was happening Behind his screwedup eyelids a forest of
ngers seemed to be moving in a sort of dance weaving in and out disappearing
behind one another and reappearing again He was trying to count them he
could not remember why He knew only that it was impossible to count them
and that this was somehow due to the mysterious identity between ve and
four The pain died down again When he opened his eyes it was to nd that
he was still seeing the same thing Innumerable ngers like moving trees were
still streaming past in either direction crossing and recrossing He shut his eyes
again
How many ngers am I holding up Winston

===== Page 147 =====
I dont know I dont know You will kill me if you do that again Four
ve six  in all honesty I dont know
Better said OBrien
A needle slid into Winstons arm Almost in the same instant a blissful heal
ing warmth spread all through his body The pain was already halfforgotten
He opened his eyes and looked up gratefully at OBrien At sight of the heavy
lined face so ugly and so intelligent his heart seemed to turn over If he could
have moved he would have stretched out a hand and laid it on OBrien arm He
had never loved him so deeply as at this moment and not merely because he
had stopped the pain The old feeling that it bottom it did not matter whether
OBrien was a friend or an enemy had come back OBrien was a person who
could be talked to Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be
understood OBrien had tortured him to the edge of lunacy and in a little
while it was certain he would send him to his death It made no dierence In
some sense that went deeper than friendship they were intimates somewhere
or other although the actual words might never be spoken there was a place
where they could meet and talk OBrien was looking down at him with an
expression which suggested that the same thought might be in his own mind
When he spoke it was in an easy conversational tone
Do you know where you are Winston he said
I dont know I can guess In the Ministry of Love
Do you know how long you have been here
I dont know Days weeks months  I think it is months
And why do you imagine that we bring people to this place
To make them confess
No that is not the reason Try again
To punish them
No exclaimed OBrien His voice had changed extraordinarily and his face
had suddenly become both stern and animated No Not merely to extract your
confession not to punish you Shall I tell you why we have brought you here To
cure you To make you sane Will you understand Winston that no one whom
we bring to this place ever leaves our hands uncured We are not interested in
those stupid crimes that you have committed The Party is not interested in
the overt act the thought is all we care about We do not merely destroy our
enemies we change them Do you understand what I mean by that
He was bending over Winston His face looked enormous because of its
nearness and hideously ugly because it was seen from below Moreover it
was lled with a sort of exaltation a lunatic intensity Again Winstons heart
shrank If it had been possible he would have cowered deeper into the bed He
felt certain that OBrien was about to twist the dial out of sheer wantonness
At this moment however OBrien turned away He took a pace or two up and
down Then he continued less vehemently
The rst thing for you to understand is that in this place there are no
martyrdoms You have read of the religious persecutions of the past In the
Middle Ages there was the Inquisitlon It was a failure It set out to eradicate
heresy and ended by perpetuating it For every heretic it burned at the stake
thousands of others rose up Why was that Because the Inquisition killed
its enemies in the open and killed them while they were still unrepentant in
fact it killed them because they were unrepentant Men were dying because
they would not abandon their true beliefs Naturally all the glory belonged

===== Page 148 =====
to the victim and all the shame to the Inquisitor who burned him Later in
the twentieth century there were the totalitarians as they were called There
were the German Nazis and the Russian Communists The Russians persecuted
heresy more cruelly than the Inquisition had done And they imagined that
they had learned from the mistakes of the past they knew at any rate that
one must not make martyrs Before they exposed their victims to public trial
they deliberately set themselves to destroy their dignity They wore them down
by torture and solitude until they were despicable cringing wretches confessing
whatever was put into their mouths covering themselves with abuse accusing
and sheltering behind one another whimpering for mercy And yet after only a
few years the same thing had happened over again The dead men had become
martyrs and their degradation was forgotten Once again why was it In the
rst place because the confessions that they had made were obviously extorted
and untrue We do not make mistakes of that kind All the confessions that
are uttered here are true We make them true And above all we do not allow
the dead to rise up against us You must stop imagining that posterity will
vindicate you Winston Posterity will never hear of you You will be lifted
clean out from the stream of history We shall turn you into gas and pour you
into the stratosphere Nothing will remain of you not a name in a register not
a memory in a living brain You will be annihilated in the past as well as in the
future You will never have existed
Then why bother to torture me thought Winston with a momentary bit
terness OBrien checked his step as though Winston had uttered the thought
aloud His large ugly face came nearer with the eyes a little narrowed
You are thinking he said that since we intend to destroy you utterly so
that nothing that you say or do can make the smallest dierence  in that case
why do we go to the trouble of interrogating you rst That is what you were
thinking was it not
Yes said Winston
OBrien smiled slightly You are a aw in the pattern Winston You are a
stain that must be wiped out Did I not tell you just now that we are dierent
from the persecutors of the past We are not content with negative obedience
nor even with the most abject submission When nally you surrender to us
it must be of your own free will We do not destroy the heretic because he
resists us so long as he resists us we never destroy him We convert him we
capture his inner mind we reshape him We burn all evil and all illusion out
of him we bring him over to our side not in appearance but genuinely heart
and soul We make him one of ourselves before we kill him It is intolerable
to us that an erroneous thought should exist anywhere in the world however
secret and powerless it may be Even in the instant of death we cannot permit
any deviation In the old days the heretic walked to the stake still a heretic
proclaiming his heresy exulting in it Even the victim of the Russian purges
could carry rebellion locked up in his skull as he walked down the passage
waiting for the bullet But we make the brain perfect before we blow it out
The command of the old despotisms was Thou shalt not The command of the
totalitarians was Thou shalt Our command is Thou art No one whom we
bring to this place ever stands out against us Everyone is washed clean Even
those three miserable traitors in whose innocence you once believed  Jones
Aaronson and Rutherford  in the end we broke them down I took part
in their interrogation myself I saw them gradually worn down whimpering

===== Page 149 =====
grovelling weeping  and in the end it was not with pain or fear only with
penitence By the time we had nished with them they were only the shells of
men There was nothing left in them except sorrow for what they had done and
love of Big Brother It was touching to see how they loved him They begged
to be shot quickly so that they could die while their minds were still clean
His voice had grown almost dreamy The exaltation the lunatic enthusi
asm was still in his face He is not pretending thought Winston he is not
a hypocrite he believes every word he says What most oppressed him was
the consciousness of his own intellectual inferiority He watched the heavy yet
graceful form strolling to and fro in and out of the range of his vision OBrien
was a being in all ways larger than himself There was no idea that he had
ever had or could have that OBrien had not long ago known examined and
rejected His mind contained Winstons mind But in that case how could it be
true that OBrien was mad It must be he Winston who was mad OBrien
halted and looked down at him His voice had grown stern again
Do not imagine that you will save yourself Winston however completely
you surrender to us No one who has once gone astray is ever spared And even
if we chose to let you live out the natural term of your life still you would never
escape from us What happens to you here is for ever Understand that in
advance We shall crush you down to the point from which there is no coming
back Things will happen to you from which you could not recover if you lived
a thousand years Never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling
Everything will be dead inside you Never again will you be capable of love
or friendship or joy of living or laughter or curiosity or courage or integrity
You will be hollow We shall squeeze you empty and then we shall ll you with
ourselves
He paused and signed to the man in the white coat Winston was aware
of some heavy piece of apparatus being pushed into place behind his head
OBrien had sat down beside the bed so that his face was almost on a level
with Winstons
Three thousand he said speaking over Winstons head to the man in the
white coat
Two soft pads which felt slightly moist clamped themselves against Win
stons temples He quailed There was pain coming a new kind of pain OBrien
laid a hand reassuringly almost kindly on his
This time it will not hurt he said Keep your eyes xed on mine
At this moment there was a devastating explosion or what seemed like an
explosion though it was not certain whether there was any noise There was
undoubtedly a blinding ash of light Winston was not hurt only prostrated
Although he had already been lying on his back when the thing happened he
had a curious feeling that he had been knocked into that position A terric
painless blow had attened him out Also something had happened inside his
head As his eyes regained their focus he remembered who he was and where
he was and recognized the face that was gazing into his own but somewhere
or other there was a large patch of emptiness as though a piece had been taken
out of his brain
It will not last said OBrien Look me in the eyes What country is
Oceania at war with
Winston thought He knew what was meant by Oceania and that he himself
was a citizen of Oceania He also remembered Eurasia and Eastasia but who

===== Page 150 =====
was at war with whom he did not know In fact he had not been aware that
there was any war
I dont remember
Oceania is at war with Eastasia Do you remember that now
Yes
Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia Since the beginning of your
life since the beginning of the Party since the beginning of history the war has
continued without a break always the same war Do you remember that
Yes
 Eleven years ago you created a legend about three men who had been
condemned to death for treachery You pretended that you had seen a piece of
paper which proved them innocent No such piece of paper ever existed You
invented it and later you grew to believe in it You remember now the very
moment at which you rst invented it Do you remember that
Yes
Just now I held up the ngers of my hand to you You saw ve ngers Do
you remember that
Yes
OBrien held up the ngers of his left hand with the thumb concealed
There are ve ngers there Do you see ve ngers
Yes
And he did see them for a eeting instant before the scenery of his mind
changed He saw ve ngers and there was no deformity Then everything
was normal again and the old fear the hatred and the bewilderment came
crowding back again But there had been a moment  he did not know how
long thirty seconds perhaps  of luminous certainty when each new suggestion
of OBriens had lled up a patch of emptiness and become absolute truth and
when two and two could have been three as easily as ve if that were what was
needed It had faded but before OBrien had dropped his hand but though
he could not recapture it he could remember it as one remembers a vivid
experience at some period of ones life when one was in eect a dierent person
You see now said OBrien that it is at any rate possible
Yes said Winston
OBrien stood up with a satised air Over to his left Winston saw the man
in the white coat break an ampoule and draw back the plunger of a syringe
OBrien turned to Winston with a smile In almost the old manner he resettled
his spectacles on his nose
Do you remember writing in your diary he said that it did not matter
whether I was a friend or an enemy since I was at least a person who understood
you and could be talked to You were right I enjoy talking to you Your mind
appeals to me It resembles my own mind except that you happen to be insane
Before we bring the session to an end you can ask me a few questions if you
choose
Any question I like
Anything He saw that Winstons eyes were upon the dial It is switched
o What is your rst question
What have you done with Julia said Winston
OBrien smiled again She betrayed you Winston Immediatelyunreservedly
I have seldom seen anyone come over to us so promptly You would hardly
recognize her if you saw her All her rebelliousness her deceit her folly her

===== Page 151 =====
dirtymindedness  everything has been burned out of her It was a perfect
conversion a textbook case
You tortured her
OBrien left this unanswered Next question he said
Does Big Brother exist
Of course he exists The Party exists Big Brother is the embodiment of
the Party
Does he exist in the same way as I exist
You do not exist said OBrien
Once again the sense of helplessness assailed him He knew or he could
imagine the arguments which proved his own nonexistence but they were non
sense they were only a play on words Did not the statement You do not exist
contain a logical absurdity But what use was it to say so His mind shrivelled
as he thought of the unanswerable mad arguments with which OBrien would
demolish him
I think I exist he said wearily I am conscious of my own identity I was
born and I shall die I have arms and legs I occupy a particular point in space
No other solid object can occupy the same point simultaneously In that sense
does Big Brother exist
It is of no importance He exists
Will Big Brother ever die
Of course not How could he die Next question
Does the Brotherhood exist
That Winston you will never know If we choose to set you free when we
have nished with you and if you live to be ninety years old still you will never
learn whether the answer to that question is Yes or No As long as you live it
will be an unsolved riddle in your mind
Winston lay silent His breast rose and fell a little faster He still had not
asked the question that had come into his mind the rst He had got to ask it
and yet it was as though his tongue would not utter it There was a trace of
amusement in OBriens face Even his spectacles seemed to wear an ironical
gleam He knows thought Winston suddenly he knows what I am going to ask
At the thought the words burst out of him
What is in Room 
The expression on OBriens face did not change He answered drily
You know what is in Room  Winston Everyone knows what is in Room

He raised a nger to the man in the white coat Evidently the session was
at an end A needle jerked into Winstons arm He sank almost instantly into
deep sleep

Chapter 
There are three stages in your reintegration said OBrien There is learning
there is understanding and there is acceptance It is time for you to enter upon
the second stage
As always Winston was lying at on his back But of late his bonds were
looser They still held him to the bed but he could move his knees a little
and could turn his head from side to side and raise his arms from the elbow
The dial also had grown to be less of a terror He could evade its pangs if he
was quickwitted enough it was chiey when he showed stupidity that OBrien
pulled the lever Sometimes they got through a whole session without use of
the dial He could not remember how many sessions there had been The whole
process seemed to stretch out over a long indenite time  weeks possibly
 and the intervals between the sessions might sometimes have been days
sometimes only an hour or two
As you lie there said OBrien you have often wondered you have even
asked me  why the Ministry of Love should expend so much time and trouble
on you And when you were free you were puzzled by what was essentially
the same question You could grasp the mechanics of the Society you lived in
but not its underlying motives Do you remember writing in your diary I
understand how I do not understand why It was when you thought about
why that you doubted your own sanity You have read the book Goldsteins
book or parts of it at least Did it tell you anything that you did not know
already
You have read it said Winston
I wrote it That is to say I collaborated in writing it No book is produced
individually as you know
Is it true what it says
A description yes The programme it sets forth is nonsense The secret
accumulation of knowledge  a gradual spread of enlightenment  ultimately
a proletarian rebellion  the overthrow of the Party You foresaw yourself that
that was what it would say It is all nonsense The proletarians will never revolt
not in a thousand years or a million They cannot I do not have to tell you the
reason you know it already If you have ever cherished any dreams of violent
insurrection you must abandon them There is no way in which the Party can
be overthrown The rule of the Party is for ever Make that the startingpoint
of your thoughts
He came closer to the bed For ever he repeated And now let us get
back to the question of how and why You understand well enough how the

===== Page 153 =====
Party maintains itself in power Now tell me why we cling to power What is
our motive Why should we want power Go on speak he added as Winston
remained silent
Nevertheless Winston did not speak for another moment or two A feeling
of weariness had overwhelmed him The faint mad gleam of enthusiasm had
come back into OBriens face He knew in advance what OBrien would say
That the Party did not seek power for its own ends but only for the good
of the majority That it sought power because men in the mass were frail
cowardly creatures who could not endure liberty or face the truth and must
be ruled over and systematically deceived by others who were stronger than
themselves That the choice for mankind lay between freedom and happiness
and that for the great bulk of mankind happiness was better That the party
was the eternal guardian of the weak a dedicated sect doing evil that good
might come sacricing its own happiness to that of others The terrible thing
thought Winston the terrible thing was that when OBrien said this he would
believe it You could see it in his face OBrien knew everything A thousand
times better than Winston he knew what the world was really like in what
degradation the mass of human beings lived and by what lies and barbarities
the Party kept them there He had understood it all weighed it all and it
made no dierence all was justied by the ultimate purpose What can you
do thought Winston against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself
who gives your arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy
You are ruling over us for our own good he said feebly You believe that
human beings are not t to govern themselves and therefore
He started and almost cried out A pang of pain had shot through his body
OBrien had pushed the lever of the dial up to thirtyve
That was stupid Winston stupid he said You should know better than
to say a thing like that
He pulled the lever back and continued
Now I will tell you the answer to my question It is this The Party seeks
power entirely for its own sake We are not interested in the good of others  we
are interested solely in power Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness
only power pure power What pure power means you will understand presently
We are dierent from all the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we
are doing All the others even those who resembled ourselves were cowards
and hypocrites The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very
close to us in their methods but they never had the courage to recognize their
own motives They pretended perhaps they even believed that they had seized
power unwillingly and for a limited time and that just round the corner there
lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal We are not like
that We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing
it Power is not a means it is an end One does not establish a dictatorship in
order to safeguard a revolution one makes the revolution in order to establish
the dictatorship The object of persecution is persecution The object of torture
is torture The object of power is power Now do you begin to understand me
Winston was struck as he had been struck before by the tiredness of
OBriens face It was strong and eshy and brutal it was full of intelligence
and a sort of controlled passion before which he felt himself helpless but it was
tired There were pouches under the eyes the skin sagged from the cheekbones
OBrien leaned over him deliberately bringing the worn face nearer

===== Page 154 =====
You are thinking he said that my face is old and tired You are thinking
that I talk of power and yet I am not even able to prevent the decay of my
own body Can you not understand Winston that the individual is only a cell
The weariness of the cell is the vigour of the organism Do you die when you
cut your ngernails
He turned away from the bed and began strolling up and down again one
hand in his pocket
We are the priests of power he said God is power But at present power is
only a word so far as you are concerned It is time for you to gather some idea of
what power means The rst thing you must realize is that power is collective
The individual only has power in so far as he ceases to be an individual You
know the Party slogan Freedom is Slavery Has it ever occurred to you that
it is reversible Slavery is freedom Alone  free  the human being is always
defeated It must be so because every human being is doomed to die which is
the greatest of all failures But if he can make complete utter submission if he
can escape from his identity if he can merge himself in the Party so that he is
the Party then he is allpowerful and immortal The second thing for you to
realize is that power is power over human beings Over the body but above all
over the mind Power over matter  external reality as you would call it  is
not important Already our control over matter is absolute
For a moment Winston ignored the dial He made a violent eort to raise
himself into a sitting position and merely succeeded in wrenching his body
painfully
But how can you control matter he burst out You dont even control
the climate or the law of gravity And there are disease pain death
OBrien silenced him by a movement of his hand We control matter because
we control the mind Reality is inside the skull You will learn by degrees
Winston There is nothing that we could not do Invisibility levitation 
anything I could oat o this oor like a soap bubble if I wish to I do not wish
to because the Party does not wish it You must get rid of those nineteenth
century ideas about the laws of Nature We make the laws of Nature
But you do not You are not even masters of this planet What about
Eurasia and Eastasia You have not conquered them yet
Unimportant We shall conquer them when it suits us And if we did not
what dierence would it make We can shut them out of existence Oceania is
the world
But the world itself is only a speck of dust And man is tiny helpless How
long has he been in existence For millions of years the earth was uninhabited
Nonsense The earth is as old as we are no older How could it be older
Nothing exists except through human consciousness
But the rocks are full of the bones of extinct animals  mammoths and
mastodons and enormous reptiles which lived here long before man was ever
heard of
Have you ever seen those bones Winston Of course not Nineteenth
century biologists invented them Before man there was nothing After man if
he could come to an end there would be nothing Outside man there is nothing
But the whole universe is outside us Look at the stars Some of them are
a million lightyears away They are out of our reach for ever
What are the stars said OBrien indierently They are bits of re a few
kilometres away We could reach them if we wanted to Or we could blot them

===== Page 155 =====
out The earth is the centre of the universe The sun and the stars go round it
Winston made another convulsive movement This time he did not say
anything OBrien continued as though answering a spoken objection
For certain purposes of course that is not true When we navigate the
ocean or when we predict an eclipse we often nd it convenient to assume that
the earth goes round the sun and that the stars are millions upon millions of
kilometres away But what of it Do you suppose it is beyond us to produce a
dual system of astronomy The stars can be near or distant according as we
need them Do you suppose our mathematicians are unequal to that Have you
forgotten doublethink
Winston shrank back upon the bed Whatever he said the swift answer
crushed him like a bludgeon And yet he knew he knew that he was in the
right The belief that nothing exists outside your own mind  surely there
must be some way of demonstrating that it was false Had it not been exposed
long ago as a fallacy There was even a name for it which he had forgotten A
faint smile twitched the corners of OBriens mouth as he looked down at him
I told you Winston he said that metaphysics is not your strong point
The word you are trying to think of is solipsism But you are mistaken This is
not solipsism Collective solipsism if you like But that is a dierent thing in
fact the opposite thing All this is a digression he added in a dierent tone
The real power the power we have to ght for night and day is not power over
things but over men He paused and for a moment assumed again his air of
a schoolmaster questioning a promising pupil How does one man assert his
power over another Winston
Winston thought By making him suer he said
Exactly By making him suer Obedience is not enough Unless he is suf
fering how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his own Power
is in inicting pain and humiliation Power is in tearing human minds to pieces
and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing Do you
begin to see then what kind of world we are creating It is the exact opposite
of the stupid hedonistic Utopias that the old reformers imagined A world of
fear and treachery is torment a world of trampling and being trampled upon
a world which will grow not less but more merciless as it renes itself Progress
in our world will be progress towards more pain The old civilizations claimed
that they were founded on love or justice Ours is founded upon hatred In our
world there will be no emotions except fear rage triumph and selfabasement
Everything else we shall destroy everything Already we are breaking down the
habits of thought which have survived from before the Revolution We have cut
the links between child and parent and between man and man and between
man and woman No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer
But in the future there will be no wives and no friends Children will be taken
from their mothers at birth as one takes eggs from a hen The sex instinct
will be eradicated Procreation will be an annual formality like the renewal of a
ration card We shall abolish the orgasm Our neurologists are at work upon it
now There will be no loyalty except loyalty towards the Party There will be
no love except the love of Big Brother There will be no laughter except the
laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy There will be no art no literature no
science When we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science There
will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness There will be no curiosity
no enjoyment of the process of life All competing pleasures will be destroyed

===== Page 156 =====
But always  do not forget this Winston  always there will be the intoxica
tion of power constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler Always at
every moment there will be the thrill of victory the sensation of trampling on
an enemy who is helpless If you want a picture of the future imagine a boot
stamping on a human face  for ever
He paused as though he expected Winston to speak Winston had tried to
shrink back into the surface of the bed again He could not say anything His
heart seemed to be frozen OBrien went on
And remember that it is for ever The face will always be there to be
stamped upon The heretic the enemy of society will always be there so
that he can be defeated and humiliated over again Everything that you have
undergone since you have been in our hands  all that will continue and
worse The espionage the betrayals the arrests the tortures the executions
the disappearances will never cease It will be a world of terror as much as a
world of triumph The more the Party is powerful the less it will be tolerant
the weaker the opposition the tighter the despotism Goldstein and his heresies
will live for ever Every day at every moment they will be defeated discredited
ridiculed spat upon and yet they will always survive This drama that I have
played out with you during seven years will be played out over and over again
generation after generation always in subtler forms Always we shall have the
heretic here at our mercy screaming with pain broken up contemptible 
and in the end utterly penitent saved from himself crawling to our feet of his
own accord That is the world that we are preparing Winston A world of
victory after victory triumph after triumph after triumph an endless pressing
pressing pressing upon the nerve of power You are beginning I can see to
realize what that world will be like But in the end you will do more than
understand it You will accept it welcome it become part of it
Winston had recovered himself suciently to speak You cant he said
weakly
What do you mean by that remark Winston
You could not create such a world as you have just described It is a dream
It is impossible
Why
It is impossible to found a civilization on fear and hatred and cruelty It
would never endure
Why not
It would have no vitality It would disintegrate It would commit suicide
Nonsense You are under the impression that hatred is more exhausting
than love Why should it be And if it were what dierence would that make
Suppose that we choose to wear ourselves out faster Suppose that we quicken
the tempo of human life till men are senile at thirty Still what dierence would
it make Can you not understand that the death of the individual is not death
The party is immortal
As usual the voice had battered Winston into helplessness Moreover he
was in dread that if he persisted in his disagreement OBrien would twist the
dial again And yet he could not keep silent Feebly without arguments with
nothing to support him except his inarticulate horror of what OBrien had said
he returned to the attack
I dont know  I dont care Somehow you will fail Something will defeat
you Life will defeat you

===== Page 157 =====
We control life Winston at all its levels You are imagining that there is
something called human nature which will be outraged by what we do and will
turn against us But we create human nature Men are innitely malleable Or
perhaps you have returned to your old idea that the proletarians or the slaves
will arise and overthrow us Put it out of your mind They are helpless like the
animals Humanity is the Party The others are outside  irrelevant
I dont care In the end they will beat you Sooner or later they will see
you for what you are and then they will tear you to pieces
Do you see any evidence that that is happening Or any reason why it
should
No I believe it I know that you will fail There is something in the universe
 I dont know some spirit some principle  that you will never overcome
Do you believe in God Winston
No
Then what is it this principle that will defeat us
I dont know The spirit of Man
And do you consider yourself a man
Yes
If you are a man Winston you are the last man Your kind is extinct
we are the inheritors Do you understand that you are alone You are outside
history you are nonexistent His manner changed and he said more harshly
And you consider yourself morally superior to us with our lies and our cruelty
Yes I consider myself superior
OBrien did not speak Two other voices were speaking After a moment
Winston recognized one of them as his own It was a soundtrack of the con
versation he had had with OBrien on the night when he had enrolled himself
in the Brotherhood He heard himself promising to lie to steal to forge to
murder to encourage drugtaking and prostitution to disseminate venereal dis
eases to throw vitriol in a childs face OBrien made a small impatient gesture
as though to say that the demonstration was hardly worth making Then he
turned a switch and the voices stopped
Get up from that bed he said
The bonds had loosened themselves Winston lowered himself to the oor
and stood up unsteadily
You are the last man said OBrien You are the guardian of the human
spirit You shall see yourself as you are Take o your clothes
Winston undid the bit of string that held his overalls together The zip
fastener had long since been wrenched out of them He could not remember
whether at any time since his arrest he had taken o all his clothes at one
time Beneath the overalls his body was looped with lthy yellowish rags just
recognizable as the remnants of underclothes As he slid them to the ground
he saw that there was a threesided mirror at the far end of the room He
approached it then stopped short An involuntary cry had broken out of him
Go on said OBrien Stand between the wings of the mirror You shall
see the side view as well
He had stopped because he was frightened A bowed greycoloured skeleton
like thing was coming towards him Its actual appearance was frightening and
not merely the fact that he knew it to be himself He moved closer to the glass
The creatures face seemed to be protruded because of its bent carriage A
forlorn jailbirds face with a nobby forehead running back into a bald scalp a

===== Page 158 =====
crooked nose and batteredlooking cheekbones above which his eyes were erce
and watchful The cheeks were seamed the mouth had a drawnin look Cer
tainly it was his own face but it seemed to him that it had changed more than
he had changed inside The emotions it registered would be dierent from the
ones he felt He had gone partially bald For the rst moment he had thought
that he had gone grey as well but it was only the scalp that was grey Except
for his hands and a circle of his face his body was grey all over with ancient
ingrained dirt Here and there under the dirt there were the red scars of wounds
and near the ankle the varicose ulcer was an inamed mass with akes of skin
peeling o it But the truly frightening thing was the emaciation of his body
The barrel of the ribs was as narrow as that of a skeleton the legs had shrunk
so that the knees were thicker than the thighs He saw now what OBrien had
meant about seeing the side view The curvature of the spine was astonishing
The thin shoulders were hunched forward so as to make a cavity of the chest
the scraggy neck seemed to be bending double under the weight of the skull
At a guess he would have said that it was the body of a man of sixty suering
from some malignant disease
You have thought sometimes said OBrien that my face  the face of a
member of the Inner Party  looks old and worn What do you think of your
own face
He seized Winstons shoulder and spun him round so that he was facing him
Look at the condition you are in he said Look at this lthy grime all
over your body Look at the dirt between your toes Look at that disgusting
running sore on your leg Do you know that you stink like a goat Probably
you have ceased to notice it Look at your emaciation Do you see I can
make my thumb and forenger meet round your bicep I could snap your neck
like a carrot Do you know that you have lost twentyve kilograms since you
have been in our hands Even your hair is coming out in handfuls Look He
plucked at Winstons head and brought away a tuft of hair Open your mouth
Nine ten eleven teeth left How many had you when you came to us And the
few you have left are dropping out of your head Look here
He seized one of Winstons remaining front teeth between his powerful thumb
and forenger A twinge of pain shot through Winstons jaw OBrien had
wrenched the loose tooth out by the roots He tossed it across the cell
You are rotting away he said you are falling to pieces What are you A
bag of lth Now turn around and look into that mirror again Do you see that
thing facing you That is the last man If you are human that is humanity
Now put your clothes on again
Winston began to dress himself with slow sti movements Until now he had
not seemed to notice how thin and weak he was Only one thought stirred in his
mind that he must have been in this place longer than he had imagined Then
suddenly as he xed the miserable rags round himself a feeling of pity for his
ruined body overcame him Before he knew what he was doing he had collapsed
on to a small stool that stood beside the bed and burst into tears He was aware
of his ugliness his gracelessness a bundle of bones in lthy underclothes sitting
weeping in the harsh white light but he could not stop himself OBrien laid a
hand on his shoulder almost kindly
It will not last for ever he said You can escape from it whenever you
choose Everything depends on yourself
You did it sobbed Winston You reduced me to this state

===== Page 159 =====
No Winston you reduced yourself to it This is what you accepted when
you set yourself up against the Party It was all contained in that rst act
Nothing has happened that you did not foresee
He paused and then went on
We have beaten you Winston We have broken you up You have seen
what your body is like Your mind is in the same state I do not think there
can be much pride left in you You have been kicked and ogged and insulted
you have screamed with pain you have rolled on the oor in your own blood
and vomit You have whimpered for mercy you have betrayed everybody and
everything Can you think of a single degradation that has not happened to
you
Winston had stopped weeping though the tears were still oozing out of his
eyes He looked up at OBrien
I have not betrayed Julia he said
OBrien looked down at him thoughtfully No he said no that is perfectly
true You have not betrayed Julia
The peculiar reverence for OBrien which nothing seemed able to destroy
ooded Winstons heart again How intelligent he thought how intelligent
Never did OBrien fail to understand what was said to him Anyone else on
earth would have answered promptly that he had betrayed Julia For what was
there that they had not screwed out of him under the torture He had told
them everything he knew about her her habits her character her past life he
had confessed in the most trivial detail everything that had happened at their
meetings all that he had said to her and she to him their blackmarket meals
their adulteries their vague plottings against the Party  everything And yet
in the sense in which he intended the word he had not betrayed her He had not
stopped loving her his feelings towards her had remained the same OBrien
had seen what he meant without the need for explanation
Tell me he said how soon will they shoot me
It might be a long time said OBrien You are a dicult case But dont
give up hope Everyone is cured sooner or later In the end we shall shoot you

Chapter 
He was much better He was growing fatter and stronger every day if it was
proper to speak of days
The white light and the humming sound were the same as ever but the cell
was a little more comfortable than the others he had been in There was a
pillow and a mattress on the plank bed and a stool to sit on They had given
him a bath and they allowed him to wash himself fairly frequently in a tin
basin They even gave him warm water to wash with They had given him new
underclothes and a clean suit of overalls They had dressed his varicose ulcer
with soothing ointment They had pulled out the remnants of his teeth and
given him a new set of dentures
Weeks or months must have passed It would have been possible now to keep
count of the passage of time if he had felt any interest in doing so since he was
being fed at what appeared to be regular intervals He was getting he judged
three meals in the twentyfour hours sometimes he wondered dimly whether
he was getting them by night or by day The food was surprisingly good with
meat at every third meal Once there was even a packet of cigarettes He had
no matches but the neverspeaking guard who brought his food would give him
a light The rst time he tried to smoke it made him sick but he persevered
and spun the packet out for a long time smoking half a cigarette after each
meal
They had given him a white slate with a stump of pencil tied to the corner
At rst he made no use of it Even when he was awake he was completely
torpid Often he would lie from one meal to the next almost without stirring
sometimes asleep sometimes waking into vague reveries in which it was too
much trouble to open his eyes He had long grown used to sleeping with a
strong light on his face It seemed to make no dierence except that ones
dreams were more coherent He dreamed a great deal all through this time
and they were always happy dreams He was in the Golden Country or he was
sitting among enormous glorious sunlit ruins with his mother with Julia with
OBrien  not doing anything merely sitting in the sun talking of peaceful
things Such thoughts as he had when he was awake were mostly about his
dreams He seemed to have lost the power of intellectual eort now that the
stimulus of pain had been removed He was not bored he had no desire for
conversation or distraction Merely to be alone not to be beaten or questioned
to have enough to eat and to be clean all over was completely satisfying
By degrees he came to spend less time in sleep but he still felt no impulse to
get o the bed All he cared for was to lie quiet and feel the strength gathering in

his body He would nger himself here and there trying to make sure that it was
not an illusion that his muscles were growing rounder and his skin tauter Finally
it was established beyond a doubt that he was growing fatter his thighs were
now denitely thicker than his knees After that reluctantly at rst he began
exercising himself regularly In a little while he could walk three kilometres
measured by pacing the cell and his bowed shoulders were growing straighter
He attempted more elaborate exercises and was astonished and humiliated to
nd what things he could not do He could not move out of a walk he could
not hold his stool out at arms length he could not stand on one leg without
falling over He squatted down on his heels and found that with agonizing
pains in thigh and calf he could just lift himself to a standing position He lay
at on his belly and tried to lift his weight by his hands It was hopeless he
could not raise himself a centimetre But after a few more days  a few more
mealtimes  even that feat was accomplished A time came when he could
do it six times running He began to grow actually proud of his body and to
cherish an intermittent belief that his face also was growing back to normal
Only when he chanced to put his hand on his bald scalp did he remember the
seamed ruined face that had looked back at him out of the mirror
His mind grew more active He sat down on the plank bed his back against
the wall and the slate on his knees and set to work deliberately at the task of
reeducating himself
He had capitulated that was agreed In reality as he saw now he had been
ready to capitulate long before he had taken the decision From the moment
when he was inside the Ministry of Love  and yes even during those minutes
when he and Julia had stood helpless while the iron voice from the telescreen told
them what to do  he had grasped the frivolity the shallowness of his attempt
to set himself up against the power of the Party He knew now that for seven
years the Thought police had watched him like a beetle under a magnifying
glass There was no physical act no word spoken aloud that they had not
noticed no train of thought that they had not been able to infer Even the
speck of whitish dust on the cover of his diary they had carefully replaced
They had played soundtracks to him shown him photographs Some of them
were photographs of Julia and himself Yes even  He could not ght against
the Party any longer Besides the Party was in the right It must be so how
could the immortal collective brain be mistaken By what external standard
could you check its judgements Sanity was statistical It was merely a question
of learning to think as they thought Only
The pencil felt thick and awkward in his ngers He began to write down
the thoughts that came into his head He wrote rst in large clumsy capitals
FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
Then almost without a pause he wrote beneath it
TWO AND TWO MAKE FIVE
But then there came a sort of check His mind as though shying away from
something seemed unable to concentrate He knew that he knew what came
next but for the moment he could not recall it When he did recall it it was
only by consciously reasoning out what it must be it did not come of its own
accord He wrote
GOD IS POWER
He accepted everything The past was alterable The past never had been
altered Oceania was at war with Eastasia Oceania had always been at war

===== Page 162 =====
with Eastasia Jones Aaronson and Rutherford were guilty of the crimes they
were charged with He had never seen the photograph that disproved their guilt
It had never existed he had invented it He remembered remembering contrary
things but those were false memories products of selfdeception How easy it
all was Only surrender and everything else followed It was like swimming
against a current that swept you backwards however hard you struggled and
then suddenly deciding to turn round and go with the current instead of oppos
ing it Nothing had changed except your own attitude the predestined thing
happened in any case He hardly knew why he had ever rebelled Everything
was easy except
Anything could be true The socalled laws of Nature were nonsense The
law of gravity was nonsense If I wished OBrien had said I could oat o
this oor like a soap bubble Winston worked it out If he thinks he oats o
the oor and if I simultaneously think I see him do it then the thing happens
Suddenly like a lump of submerged wreckage breaking the surface of water
the thought burst into his mind It doesnt really happen We imagine it
It is hallucination He pushed the thought under instantly The fallacy was
obvious It presupposed that somewhere or other outside oneself there was
a real world where real things happened But how could there be such a
world What knowledge have we of anything save through our own minds All
happenings are in the mind Whatever happens in all minds truly happens
He had no diculty in disposing of the fallacy and he was in no danger of
succumbing to it He realized nevertheless that it ought never to have occurred
to him The mind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought
presented itself The process should be automatic instinctive Crimestop they
called it in Newspeak
He set to work to exercise himself in crimestop He presented himself with
propositions  the Party says the earth is at the party says that ice is
heavier than water  and trained himself in not seeing or not understanding
the arguments that contradicted them It was not easy It needed great powers
of reasoning and improvisation The arithmetical problems raised for instance
by such a statement as two and two make ve were beyond his intellectual
grasp It needed also a sort of athleticism of mind an ability at one moment
to make the most delicate use of logic and at the next to be unconscious of the
crudest logical errors Stupidity was as necessary as intelligence and as dicult
to attain
All the while with one part of his mind he wondered how soon they would
shoot him Everything depends on yourself OBrien had said but he knew
that there was no conscious act by which he could bring it nearer It might
be ten minutes hence or ten years They might keep him for years in solitary
connement they might send him to a labourcamp they might release him for
a while as they sometimes did It was perfectly possible that before he was shot
the whole drama of his arrest and interrogation would be enacted all over again
The one certain thing was that death never came at an expected moment The
tradition  the unspoken tradition somehow you knew it though you never
heard it saidwas that they shot you from behind always in the back of the
head without warning as you walked down a corridor from cell to cell
One day  but one day was not the right expression just as probably it
was in the middle of the night once  he fell into a strange blissful reverie
He was walking down the corridor waiting for the bullet He knew that it was

===== Page 163 =====
coming in another moment Everything was settled smoothed out reconciled
There were no more doubts no more arguments no more pain no more fear
His body was healthy and strong He walked easily with a joy of movement
and with a feeling of walking in sunlight He was not any longer in the narrow
white corridors in the Ministry of Love he was in the enormous sunlit passage
a kilometre wide down which he had seemed to walk in the delirium induced
by drugs He was in the Golden Country following the foottrack across the
old rabbitcropped pasture He could feel the short springy turf under his feet
and the gentle sunshine on his face At the edge of the eld were the elm trees
faintly stirring and somewhere beyond that was the stream where the dace lay
in the green pools under the willows
Suddenly he started up with a shock of horror The sweat broke out on his
backbone He had heard himself cry aloud
Julia Julia Julia my love Julia
For a moment he had had an overwhelming hallucination of her presence
She had seemed to be not merely with him but inside him It was as though
she had got into the texture of his skin In that moment he had loved her far
more than he had ever done when they were together and free Also he knew
that somewhere or other she was still alive and needed his help
He lay back on the bed and tried to compose himself What had he done
How many years had he added to his servitude by that moment of weakness
In another moment he would hear the tramp of boots outside They could
not let such an outburst go unpunished They would know now if they had not
known before that he was breaking the agreement he had made with them He
obeyed the Party but he still hated the Party In the old days he had hidden
a heretical mind beneath an appearance of conformity Now he had retreated
a step further in the mind he had surrendered but he had hoped to keep the
inner heart inviolate He knew that he was in the wrong but he preferred to
be in the wrong They would understand that OBrien would understand it
It was all confessed in that single foolish cry
He would have to start all over again It might take years He ran a hand
over his face trying to familiarize himself with the new shape There were deep
furrows in the cheeks the cheekbones felt sharp the nose attened Besides
since last seeing himself in the glass he had been given a complete new set of
teeth It was not easy to preserve inscrutability when you did not know what
your face looked like In any case mere control of the features was not enough
For the rst time he perceived that if you want to keep a secret you must also
hide it from yourself You must know all the while that it is there but until
it is needed you must never let it emerge into your consciousness in any shape
that could be given a name From now onwards he must not only think right
he must feel right dream right And all the while he must keep his hatred
locked up inside him like a ball of matter which was part of himself and yet
unconnected with the rest of him a kind of cyst
One day they would decide to shoot him You could not tell when it would
happen but a few seconds beforehand it should be possible to guess It was
always from behind walking down a corridor Ten seconds would be enough
In that time the world inside him could turn over And then suddenly without
a word uttered without a check in his step without the changing of a line in
his face  suddenly the camouage would be down and bang would go the
batteries of his hatred Hatred would ll him like an enormous roaring ame

===== Page 164 =====
And almost in the same instant bang would go the bullet too late or too early
They would have blown his brain to pieces before they could reclaim it The
heretical thought would be unpunished unrepented out of their reach for ever
They would have blown a hole in their own perfection To die hating them that
was freedom
He shut his eyes It was more dicult than accepting an intellectual disci
pline It was a question of degrading himself mutilating himself He had got
to plunge into the lthiest of lth What was the most horrible sickening thing
of all He thought of Big Brother The enormous face because of constantly
seeing it on posters he always thought of it as being a metre wide with its
heavy black moustache and the eyes that followed you to and fro seemed to
oat into his mind of its own accord What were his true feelings towards Big
Brother
There was a heavy tramp of boots in the passage The steel door swung open
with a clang OBrien walked into the cell Behind him were the waxenfaced
ocer and the blackuniformed guards
Get up said OBrien Come here
Winston stood opposite him OBrien took Winstons shoulders between his
strong hands and looked at him closely
You have had thoughts of deceiving me he said That was stupid Stand
up straighter Look me in the face
He paused and went on in a gentler tone
You are improving Intellectually there is very little wrong with you It is
only emotionally that you have failed to make progress Tell me Winston 
and remember no lies you know that I am always able to detect a lie  tell
me what are your true feelings towards Big Brother
I hate him
You hate him Good Then the time has come for you to take the last step
You must love Big Brother It is not enough to obey him you must love him
He released Winston with a little push towards the guards
Room  he said

===== Page 165 =====
Chapter 
At each stage of his imprisonment he had known or seemed to know where
abouts he was in the windowless building Possibly there were slight dierences
in the air pressure The cells where the guards had beaten him were below
ground level The room where he had been interrogated by OBrien was high
up near the roof This place was many metres underground as deep down as it
was possible to go
It was bigger than most of the cells he had been in But he hardly noticed
his surroundings All he noticed was that there were two small tables straight
in front of him each covered with green baize One was only a metre or two
from him the other was further away near the door He was strapped upright
in a chair so tightly that he could move nothing not even his head A sort of
pad gripped his head from behind forcing him to look straight in front of him
For a moment he was alone then the door opened and OBrien came in
You asked me once said OBrien what was in Room  I told you that
you knew the answer already Everyone knows it The thing that is in Room
 is the worst thing in the world
The door opened again A guard came in carrying something made of wire
a box or basket of some kind He set it down on the further table Because of
the position in which OBrien was standing Winston could not see what the
thing was
The worst thing in the world said OBrien varies from individual to in
dividual It may be burial alive or death by re or by drowning or by impale
ment or fty other deaths There are cases where it is some quite trivial thing
not even fatal
He had moved a little to one side so that Winston had a better view of the
thing on the table It was an oblong wire cage with a handle on top for carrying
it by Fixed to the front of it was something that looked like a fencing mask
with the concave side outwards Although it was three or four metres away from
him he could see that the cage was divided lengthways into two compartments
and that there was some kind of creature in each They were rats
In your case said OBrien the worst thing in the world happens to be rats
A sort of premonitory tremor a fear of he was not certain what had passed
through Winston as soon as he caught his rst glimpse of the cage But at this
moment the meaning of the masklike attachment in front of it suddenly sank
into him His bowels seemed to turn to water
You cant do that he cried out in a high cracked voice You couldnt you
couldnt Its impossible

===== Page 166 =====
Do you remember said OBrien the moment of panic that used to occur
in your dreams There was a wall of blackness in front of you and a roaring
sound in your ears There was something terrible on the other side of the wall
You knew that you knew what it was but you dared not drag it into the open
It was the rats that were on the other side of the wall
OBrien said Winston making an eort to control his voice You know
this is not necessary What is it that you want me to do
OBrien made no direct answer When he spoke it was in the schoolmasterish
manner that he sometimes aected He looked thoughtfully into the distance
as though he were addressing an audience somewhere behind Winstons back
By itself he said pain is not always enough There are occasions when a
human being will stand out against pain even to the point of death But for
everyone there is something unendurable  something that cannot be contem
plated Courage and cowardice are not involved If you are falling from a height
it is not cowardly to clutch at a rope If you have come up from deep water it is
not cowardly to ll your lungs with air It is merely an instinct which cannot be
destroyed It is the same with the rats For you they are unendurable They
are a form of pressure that you cannot withstand even if you wished to You
will do what is required of you
But what is it what is it How can I do it if I dont know what it is
OBrien picked up the cage and brought it across to the nearer table He set
it down carefully on the baize cloth Winston could hear the blood singing in
his ears He had the feeling of sitting in utter loneliness He was in the middle
of a great empty plain a at desert drenched with sunlight across which all
sounds came to him out of immense distances Yet the cage with the rats was
not two metres away from him They were enormous rats They were at the age
when a rats muzzle grows blunt and erce and his fur brown instead of grey
The rat said OBrien still addressing his invisible audience although a
rodent is carnivorous You are aware of that You will have heard of the things
that happen in the poor quarters of this town In some streets a woman dare
not leave her baby alone in the house even for ve minutes The rats are certain
to attack it Within quite a small time they will strip it to the bones They
also attack sick or dying people They show astonishing intelligence in knowing
when a human being is helpless
There was an outburst of squeals from the cage It seemed to reach Winston
from far away The rats were ghting they were trying to get at each other
through the partition He heard also a deep groan of despair That too seemed
to come from outside himself
OBrien picked up the cage and as he did so pressed something in it There
was a sharp click Winston made a frantic eort to tear himself loose from the
chair It was hopeless every part of him even his head was held immovably
OBrien moved the cage nearer It was less than a metre from Winstons face
I have pressed the rst lever said OBrien You understand the construc
tion of this cage The mask will t over your head leaving no exit When I press
this other lever the door of the cage will slide up These starving brutes will
shoot out of it like bullets Have you ever seen a rat leap through the air They
will leap on to your face and bore straight into it Sometimes they attack the
eyes rst Sometimes they burrow through the cheeks and devour the tongue
The cage was nearer it was closing in Winston heard a succession of shrill
cries which appeared to be occurring in the air above his head But he fought

===== Page 167 =====
furiously against his panic To think to think even with a split second left 
to think was the only hope Suddenly the foul musty odour of the brutes struck
his nostrils There was a violent convulsion of nausea inside him and he almost
lost consciousness Everything had gone black For an instant he was insane a
screaming animal Yet he came out of the blackness clutching an idea There
was one and only one way to save himself He must interpose another human
being the body of another human being between himself and the rats
The circle of the mask was large enough now to shut out the vision of any
thing else The wire door was a couple of handspans from his face The rats
knew what was coming now One of them was leaping up and down the other
an old scaly grandfather of the sewers stood up with his pink hands against
the bars and ercely snied the air Winston could see the whiskers and the
yellow teeth Again the black panic took hold of him He was blind helpless
mindless
It was a common punishment in Imperial China said OBrien as didacti
cally as ever
The mask was closing on his face The wire brushed his cheek And then
 no it was not relief only hope a tiny fragment of hope Too late perhaps
too late But he had suddenly understood that in the whole world there was
just one person to whom he could transfer his punishment  one body that
he could thrust between himself and the rats And he was shouting frantically
over and over
Do it to Julia Do it to Julia Not me Julia I dont care what you do to
her Tear her face o strip her to the bones Not me Julia Not me
He was falling backwards into enormous depths away from the rats He was
still strapped in the chair but he had fallen through the oor through the walls
of the building through the earth through the oceans through the atmosphere
into outer space into the gulfs between the stars  always away away away
from the rats He was light years distant but OBrien was still standing at his
side There was still the cold touch of wire against his cheek But through the
darkness that enveloped him he heard another metallic click and knew that the
cage door had clicked shut and not open

===== Page 168 =====
Chapter 
The Chestnut Tree was almost empty A ray of sunlight slanting through a
window fell on dusty tabletops It was the lonely hour of fteen A tinny music
trickled from the telescreens
Winston sat in his usual corner gazing into an empty glass Now and again
he glanced up at a vast face which eyed him from the opposite wall BIG
BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU the caption said Unbidden a waiter came
and lled his glass up with Victory Gin shaking into it a few drops from another
bottle with a quill through the cork It was saccharine avoured with cloves
the speciality of the caf e
Winston was listening to the telescreen At present only music was coming
out of it but there was a possibility that at any moment there might be a
special bulletin from the Ministry of Peace The news from the African front
was disquieting in the extreme On and o he had been worrying about it all day
A Eurasian army Oceania was at war with Eurasia Oceania had always been
at war with Eurasia was moving southward at terrifying speed The midday
bulletin had not mentioned any denite area but it was probable that already
the mouth of the Congo was a battleeld Brazzaville and Leopoldville were in
danger One did not have to look at the map to see what it meant It was not
merely a question of losing Central Africa for the rst time in the whole war
the territory of Oceania itself was menaced
A violent emotion not fear exactly but a sort of undierentiated excitement
ared up in him then faded again He stopped thinking about the war In
these days he could never x his mind on any one subject for more than a few
moments at a time He picked up his glass and drained it at a gulp As always
the gin made him shudder and even retch slightly The stu was horrible The
cloves and saccharine themselves disgusting enough in their sickly way could
not disguise the at oily smell and what was worst of all was that the smell of
gin which dwelt with him night and day was inextricably mixed up in his mind
with the smell of those
He never named them even in his thoughts and so far as it was possible he
never visualized them They were something that he was halfaware of hovering
close to his face a smell that clung to his nostrils As the gin rose in him he
belched through purple lips He had grown fatter since they released him and
had regained his old colour  indeed more than regained it His features had
thickened the skin on nose and cheekbones was coarsely red even the bald scalp
was too deep a pink A waiter again unbidden brought the chessboard and the
current issue of The Times with the page turned down at the chess problem

===== Page 169 =====
Then seeing that Winstons glass was empty he brought the gin bottle and lled
it There was no need to give orders They knew his habits The chessboard
was always waiting for him his corner table was always reserved even when
the place was full he had it to himself since nobody cared to be seen sitting too
close to him He never even bothered to count his drinks At irregular intervals
they presented him with a dirty slip of paper which they said was the bill but
he had the impression that they always undercharged him It would have made
no dierence if it had been the other way about He had always plenty of money
nowadays He even had a job a sinecure more highlypaid than his old job had
been
The music from the telescreen stopped and a voice took over Winston
raised his head to listen No bulletins from the front however It was merely
a brief announcement from the Ministry of Plenty In the preceding quarter it
appeared the Tenth ThreeYear Plans quota for bootlaces had been overfullled
by  per cent
He examined the chess problem and set out the pieces It was a tricky ending
involving a couple of knights White to play and mate in two moves Winston
looked up at the portrait of Big Brother White always mates he thought with
a sort of cloudy mysticism Always without exception it is so arranged In no
chess problem since the beginning of the world has black ever won Did it not
symbolize the eternal unvarying triumph of Good over Evil The huge face
gazed back at him full of calm power White always mates
The voice from the telescreen paused and added in a dierent and much
graver tone You are warned to stand by for an important announcement at
fteenthirty Fifteenthirty This is news of the highest importance Take care
not to miss it Fifteenthirty The tinking music struck up again
Winstons heart stirred That was the bulletin from the front instinct told
him that it was bad news that was coming All day with little spurts of ex
citement the thought of a smashing defeat in Africa had been in and out of his
mind He seemed actually to see the Eurasian army swarming across the never
broken frontier and pouring down into the tip of Africa like a column of ants
Why had it not been possible to outank them in some way The outline of the
West African coast stood out vividly in his mind He picked up the white knight
and moved it across the board There was the proper spot Even while he saw
the black horde racing southward he saw another force mysteriously assembled
suddenly planted in their rear cutting their comunications by land and sea He
felt that by willing it he was bringing that other force into existence But it
was necessary to act quickly If they could get control of the whole of Africa
if they had airelds and submarine bases at the Cape it would cut Oceania in
two It might mean anything defeat breakdown the redivision of the world
the destruction of the Party He drew a deep breath An extraordinary medley
of feelingbut it was not a medley exactly rather it was successive layers of
feeling in which one could not say which layer was undermost struggled inside
him
The spasm passed He put the white knight back in its place but for the
moment he could not settle down to serious study of the chess problem His
thoughts wandered again Almost unconsciously he traced with his nger in the
dust on the table 
They cant get inside you she had said But they could get inside you
What happens to you here is for ever OBrien had said That was a true

===== Page 170 =====
word There were things your own acts from which you could never recover
Something was killed in your breast burnt out cauterized out
He had seen her he had even spoken to her There was no danger in it
He knew as though instinctively that they now took almost no interest in his
doings He could have arranged to meet her a second time if either of them had
wanted to Actually it was by chance that they had met It was in the Park
on a vile biting day in March when the earth was like iron and all the grass
seemed dead and there was not a bud anywhere except a few crocuses which
had pushed themselves up to be dismembered by the wind He was hurrying
along with frozen hands and watering eyes when he saw her not ten metres away
from him It struck him at once that she had changed in some illdened way
They almost passed one another without a sign then he turned and followed
her not very eagerly He knew that there was no danger nobody would take
any interest in him She did not speak She walked obliquely away across the
grass as though trying to get rid of him then seemed to resign herself to having
him at her side Presently they were in among a clump of ragged leaess shrubs
useless either for concealment or as protection from the wind They halted It
was vilely cold The wind whistled through the twigs and fretted the occasional
dirtylooking crocuses He put his arm round her waist
There was no telescreen but there must be hidden microphones besides
they could be seen It did not matter nothing mattered They could have lain
down on the ground and done that if they had wanted to His esh froze with
horror at the thought of it She made no response whatever to the clasp of
his arm  she did not even try to disengage herself He knew now what had
changed in her Her face was sallower and there was a long scar partly hidden
by the hair across her forehead and temple but that was not the change It
was that her waist had grown thicker and in a surprising way had stiened
He remembered how once after the explosion of a rocket bomb he had helped
to drag a corpse out of some ruins and had been astonished not only by the
incredible weight of the thing but by its rigidity and awkwardness to handle
which made it seem more like stone than esh Her body felt like that It
occurred to him that the texture of her skin would be quite dierent from what
it had once been
He did not attempt to kiss her nor did they speak As they walked back
across the grass she looked directly at him for the rst time It was only a
momentary glance full of contempt and dislike He wondered whether it was a
dislike that came purely out of the past or whether it was inspired also by his
bloated face and the water that the wind kept squeezing from his eyes They
sat down on two iron chairs side by side but not too close together He saw
that she was about to speak She moved her clumsy shoe a few centimetres and
deliberately crushed a twig Her feet seemed to have grown broader he noticed
I betrayed you she said baldly
I betrayed you he said
She gave him another quick look of dislike
Sometimes she said they threaten you with something something you
cant stand up to cant even think about And then you say Dont do it to
me do it to somebody else do it to Soandso And perhaps you might pretend
afterwards that it was only a trick and that you just said it to make them stop
and didnt really mean it But that isnt true At the time when it happens you
do mean it You think theres no other way of saving yourself and youre quite

===== Page 171 =====
ready to save yourself that way You want it to happen to the other person
You dont give a damn what they suer All you care about is yourself
All you care about is yourself he echoed
And after that you dont feel the same towards the other person any longer
No he said you dont feel the same
There did not seem to be anything more to say The wind plastered their
thin overalls against their bodies Almost at once it became embarrassing to sit
there in silence besides it was too cold to keep still She said something about
catching her Tube and stood up to go
We must meet again he said
Yes she said we must meet again 
He followed irresolutely for a little distance half a pace behind her They
did not speak again She did not actually try to shake him o but walked at
just such a speed as to prevent his keeping abreast of her He had made up his
mind that he would accompany her as far as the Tube station but suddenly
this process of trailing along in the cold seemed pointless and unbearable He
was overwhelmed by a desire not so much to get away from Julia as to get back
to the Chestnut Tree Caf e which had never seemed so attractive as at this
moment He had a nostalgic vision of his corner table with the newspaper and
the chessboard and the everowing gin Above all it would be warm in there
The next moment not altogether by accident he allowed himself to become
separated from her by a small knot of people He made a halfhearted attempt
to catch up then slowed down turned and made o in the opposite direction
When he had gone fty metres he looked back The street was not crowded
but already he could not distinguish her Any one of a dozen hurrying gures
might have been hers Perhaps her thickened stiened body was no longer
recognizable from behind
At the time when it happens she had said you do mean it He had meant
it He had not merely said it he had wished it He had wished that she and
not he should be delivered over to the
Something changed in the music that trickled from the telescreen A cracked
and jeering note a yellow note came into it And then  perhaps it was not
happening perhaps it was only a memory taking on the semblance of sound 
a voice was singing
Under the spreading chestnut tree
I sold you and you sold me 
The tears welled up in his eyes A passing waiter noticed that his glass was
empty and came back with the gin bottle
He took up his glass and snied at it The stu grew not less but more
horrible with every mouthful he drank But it had become the element he
swam in It was his life his death and his resurrection It was gin that sank
him into stupor every night and gin that revived him every morning When he
woke seldom before eleven hundred with gummedup eyelids and ery mouth
and a back that seemed to be broken it would have been impossible even to
rise from the horizontal if it had not been for the bottle and teacup placed
beside the bed overnight Through the midday hours he sat with glazed face
the bottle handy listening to the telescreen From fteen to closingtime he
was a xture in the Chestnut Tree No one cared what he did any longer no
whistle woke him no telescreen admonished him Occasionally perhaps twice a
week he went to a dusty forgottenlooking oce in the Ministry of Truth and

===== Page 172 =====
did a little work or what was called work He had been appointed to a sub
committee of a subcommittee which had sprouted from one of the innumerable
committees dealing with minor diculties that arose in the compilation of the
Eleventh Edition of the Newspeak Dictionary They were engaged in producing
something called an Interim Report but what it was that they were reporting on
he had never denitely found out It was something to do with the question of
whether commas should be placed inside brackets or outside There were four
others on the committee all of them persons similar to himself There were days
when they assembled and then promptly dispersed again frankly admitting to
one another that there was not really anything to be done But there were other
days when they settled down to their work almost eagerly making a tremendous
show of entering up their minutes and drafting long memoranda which were
never nished  when the argument as to what they were supposedly arguing
about grew extraordinarily involved and abstruse with subtle haggling over
denitions enormous digressions quarrels threats even to appeal to higher
authority And then suddenly the life would go out of them and they would sit
round the table looking at one another with extinct eyes like ghosts fading at
cockcrow
The telescreen was silent for a moment Winston raised his head again The
bulletin But no they were merely changing the music He had the map of
Africa behind his eyelids The movement of the armies was a diagram a black
arrow tearing vertically southward and a white arrow horizontally eastward
across the tail of the rst As though for reassurance he looked up at the
imperturbable face in the portrait Was it conceivable that the second arrow
did not even exist
His interest agged again He drank another mouthful of gin picked up the
white knight and made a tentative move Check But it was evidently not the
right move because
Uncalled a memory oated into his mind He saw a candlelit room with
a vast whitecounterpaned bed and himself a boy of nine or ten sitting on
the oor shaking a dicebox and laughing excitedly His mother was sitting
opposite him and also laughing
It must have been about a month before she disappeared It was a moment
of reconciliation when the nagging hunger in his belly was forgotten and his
earlier aection for her had temporarily revived He remembered the day well
a pelting drenching day when the water streamed down the windowpane and
the light indoors was too dull to read by The boredom of the two children in
the dark cramped bedroom became unbearable Winston whined and grizzled
made futile demands for food fretted about the room pulling everything out
of place and kicking the wainscoting until the neighbours banged on the wall
while the younger child wailed intermittently In the end his mother said Now
be good and IIl buy you a toy A lovely toy  youll love it and then she had
gone out in the rain to a little general shop which was still sporadically open
nearby and came back with a cardboard box containing an outt of Snakes
and Ladders He could still remember the smell of the damp cardboard It was
a miserable outt The board was cracked and the tiny wooden dice were so
illcut that they would hardly lie on their sides Winston looked at the thing
sulkily and without interest But then his mother lit a piece of candle and they
sat down on the oor to play Soon he was wildly excited and shouting with
laughter as the tiddlywinks climbed hopefully up the ladders and then came

===== Page 173 =====
slithering down the snakes again almost to the starting point They played
eight games winning four each His tiny sister too young to understand what
the game was about had sat propped up against a bolster laughing because the
others were laughing For a whole afternoon they had all been happy together
as in his earlier childhood
He pushed the picture out of his mind It was a false memory He was
troubled by false memories occasionally They did not matter so long as one
knew them for what they were Some things had happened others had not
happened He turned back to the chessboard and picked up the white knight
again Almost in the same instant it dropped on to the board with a clatter
He had started as though a pin had run into him
A shrill trumpetcall had pierced the air It was the bulletin Victory It
always meant victory when a trumpet call preceded the news A sort of electric
drill ran through the caf e Even the waiters had started and pricked up their
ears
The trumpetcall had let loose an enormous volume of noise Already an
excited voice was gabbling from the telescreen but even as it started it was
almost drowned by a roar of cheering from outside The news had run round
the streets like magic He could hear just enough of what was issuing from the
telescreen to realize that it had all happened as he had foreseen a vast seaborne
armada had secretly assembled a sudden blow in the enemys rear the white
arrow tearing across the tail of the black Fragments of triumphant phrases
pushed themselves through the din Vast strategic manoeuvre  perfect co
ordination  utter rout  half a million prisoners  complete demoralization
 control of the whole of Africa  bring the war within measurable distance of
its end victory  greatest victory in human history  victory victory victory
Under the table Winstons feet made convulsive movements He had not
stirred from his seat but in his mind he was running swiftly running he was
with the crowds outside cheering himself deaf He looked up again at the
portrait of Big Brother The colossus that bestrode the world The rock against
which the hordes of Asia dashed themselves in vain He thought how ten minutes
agoyes only ten minutes  there had still been equivocation in his heart as he
wondered whether the news from the front would be of victory or defeat Ah it
was more than a Eurasian army that had perished Much had changed in him
since that rst day in the Ministry of Love but the nal indispensable healing
change had never happened until this moment
The voice from the telescreen was still pouring forth its tale of prisoners
and booty and slaughter but the shouting outside had died down a little The
waiters were turning back to their work One of them approached with the

Appendix
The Principles of Newspeak
Newspeak was the ocial language of Oceania and had been devised to meet
the ideological needs of Ingsoc or English Socialism In the year  there was
not as yet anyone who used Newspeak as his sole means of communication
either in speech or writing The leading articles in The Times were written in
it but this was a tour de force which could only be carried out by a specialist
It was expected that Newspeak would have nally superseded Oldspeak or
Standard English as we should call it by about the year  Meanwhile it
gained ground steadily all Party members tending to use Newspeak words and
grammatical constructions more and more in their everyday speech The version
in use in  and embodied in the Ninth and Tenth Editions of the Newspeak
Dictionary was a provisional one and contained many superuous words and
archaic formations which were due to be suppressed later It is with the nal
perfected version as embodied in the Eleventh Edition of the Dictionary that
we are concerned here
The purpose of Newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expression for
the worldview and mental habits proper to the devotees of Ingsoc but to make
all other modes of thought impossible It was intended that when Newspeak had
been adopted once and for all and Oldspeak forgotten a heretical thought 
that is a thought diverging from the principles of Ingsoc  should be literally
unthinkable at least so far as thought is dependent on words Its vocabulary
was so constructed as to give exact and often very subtle expression to every
meaning that a Party member could properly wish to express while exclud
ing all other meanings and also the possibility of arriving at them by indirect
methods This was done partly by the invention of new words but chiey by
eliminating undesirable words and by stripping such words as remained of un
orthodox meanings and so far as possible of all secondary meanings whatever
To give a single example The word free still existed in Newspeak but it could
only be used in such statements as This dog is free from lice or This eld
is free from weeds It could not be used in its old sense of  politically free
or intellectually free since political and intellectual freedom no longer existed
even as concepts and were therefore of necessity nameless Quite apart from the
suppression of denitely heretical words reduction of vocabulary was regarded
as an end in itself and no word that could be dispensed with was allowed to
survive Newspeak was designed not to extend but to diminish the range of
thought and this purpose was indirectly assisted by cutting the choice of words
down to a minimum
Newspeak was founded on the English language as we now know it though
many Newspeak sentences even when not containing newlycreated words

would be barely intelligible to an Englishspeaker of our own day Newspeak
words were divided into three distinct classes known as the A vocabulary the
B vocabulary also called compound words and the C vocabulary It will be
simpler to discuss each class separately but the grammatical peculiarities of the
language can be dealt with in the section devoted to the A vocabulary since
the same rules held good for all three categories
The A vocabulary
The A vocabulary consisted of the words needed for the business of everyday
life  for such things as eating drinking working putting on ones clothes
going up and down stairs riding in vehicles gardening cooking and the like It
was composed almost entirely of words that we already possess words like hit
run dog tree sugar house eld  but in comparison with the presentday
English vocabulary their number was extremely small while their meanings were
far more rigidly dened All ambiguities and shades of meaning had been purged
out of them So far as it could be achieved a Newspeak word of this class was
simply a staccato sound expressing one clearly understood concept It would
have been quite impossible to use the A vocabulary for literary purposes or for
political or philosophical discussion It was intended only to express simple
purposive thoughts usually involving concrete objects or physical actions
The grammar of Newspeak had two outstanding peculiarities The rst
of these was an almost complete interchangeability between dierent parts of
speech Any word in the language in principle this applied even to very abstract
words such as if or when could be used either as verb noun adjective or adverb
Between the verb and the noun form when they were of the same root there was
never any variation this rule of itself involving the destruction of many archaic
forms The word thought for example did not exist in Newspeak Its place
was taken by think which did duty for both noun and verb No etymological
principle was followed here in some cases it was the original noun that was
chosen for retention in other cases the verb Even where a noun and verb of
kindred meaning were not etymologically connected one or other of them was
frequently suppressed There was for example no such word as cut its meaning
being suciently covered by the nounverb knife Adjectives were formed by
adding the suxful to the nounverb and adverbs by adding wise Thus for
example speedful meant rapid and speedwise meant quickly Certain of our
presentday adjectives such as good strong big black soft were retained but
their total number was very small There was little need for them since almost
any adjectival meaning could be arrived at by addingful to a nounverb None
of the nowexisting adverbs was retained except for a very few already ending
inwise the wise termination was invariable The word well for example was
replaced by goodwise
In addition any word  this again applied in principle to every word in the
language  could be negatived by adding the ax un or could be strengthened
by the ax plus or for still greater emphasis doubleplus Thus for example
uncold meant warm while pluscold and doublepluscold meant respectively
very cold and superlatively cold It was also possible as in presentday En
glish to modify the meaning of almost any word by prepositional axes such
as ante post up down etc By such methods it was found possible to bring
about an enormous diminution of vocabulary Given for instance the word
good there was no need for such a word as bad since the required meaning was
equally well  indeed better  expressed by ungood All that was necessary

===== Page 177 =====
in any case where two words formed a natural pair of opposites was to decide
which of them to suppress Dark for example could be replaced by unlight or
light by undark according to preference
The second distinguishing mark of Newspeak grammar was its regularity
Subject to a few exceptions which are mentioned below all inexions followed
the same rules Thus in all verbs the preterite and the past participle were the
same and ended ined The preterite of steal was stealed the preterite of think
was thinked and so on throughout the language all such forms as swam gave
brought spoke taken etc being abolished All plurals were made by addings
ores as the case might be The plurals of man ox life were mans oxes lifes
Comparison of adjectives was invariably made by addingerest good gooder
goodest irregular forms and the more most formation being suppressed
The only classes of words that were still allowed to inect irregularly were the
pronouns the relatives the demonstrative adjectives and the auxiliary verbs
All of these followed their ancient usage except that whom had been scrapped
as unnecessary and the shall should tenses had been dropped all their uses
being covered by will and would There were also certain irregularities in word
formation arising out of the need for rapid and easy speech A word which
was dicult to utter or was liable to be incorrectly heard was held to be ipso
facto a bad word occasionally therefore for the sake of euphony extra letters
were inserted into a word or an archaic formation was retained But this need
made itself felt chiey in connexion with the B vocabulary Why so great an
importance was attached to ease of pronunciation will be made clear later in
this essay
The B vocabulary
The B vocabulary consisted of words which had been deliberately con
structed for political purposes words that is to say which not only had in
every case a political implication but were intended to impose a desirable men
tal attitude upon the person using them Without a full understanding of the
principles of Ingsoc it was dicult to use these words correctly In some cases
they couId be translated into Oldspeak or even into words taken from the A
vocabulary but this usually demanded a long paraphrase and always involved
the loss of certain overtones The B words were a sort of verbal shorthand often
packing whole ranges of ideas into a few syllables and at the same time more
accurate and forcible than ordinary language
The B words were in all cases compound words
They consisted of two or more words or portions of words welded together in
an easily pronounceable form The resulting amalgam was always a nounverb
and inected according to the ordinary rules To take a single example the
word goodthink meaning very roughly orthodoxy or if one chose to regard
it as a verb to think in an orthodox manner This inected as follows noun
verb goodthink past tense and past participle goodthinked present participle
good thinking adjective goodthinkful adverb goodthinkwise verbal noun
goodthinker
The B words were not constructed on any etymological plan The words of
which they were made up could be any parts of speech and could be placed
in any order and mutilated in any way which made them easy to pronounce
while indicating their derivation In the word crimethink thoughtcrime for
instance the think came second whereas in thinkpol Thought Police it came
rst and in the latter word police had lost its second syllable Because of the

===== Page 178 =====
great dicuIty in securing euphony irregular formations were commoner in the
B vocabulary than in the A vocabulary For example the adjective forms of
Minitrue Minipax and Miniluv were respectively Minitruthful Minipeaceful
and Minilovely simply because truefulpaxful andloveful were slightly awk
ward to pronounce In principle however all B words could inect and all
inected in exactly the same way
Some of the B words had highly subtilized meanings barely intelligible to
anyone who had not mastered the language as a whole Consider for example
such a typical sentence from a Times leading article as Oldthinkers unbellyfeel
Ingsoc The shortest rendering that one could make of this in Oldspeak would
be Those whose ideas were formed before the Revolution cannot have a full
emotional understanding of the principles of English Socialism But this is not
an adequate translation To begin with in order to
Compound words such as speakwrite were of course to be found in the A
vocabulary but these were merely convenient abbreviations and had no special
ideologcal colour
grasp the full meaning of the Newspeak sentence quoted above one would
have to have a clear idea of what is meant by Ingsoc And in addition only
a person thoroughly grounded in Ingsoc could appreciate the full force of the
word bellyfeel which implied a blind enthusiastic acceptance dicult to imagine
today or of the word oldthink which was inextricably mixed up with the idea
of wickedness and decadence But the special function of certain Newspeak
words of which oldthink was one was not so much to express meanings as to
destroy them These words necessarily few in number had had their meanings
extended until they contained within themselves whole batteries of words which
as they were suciently covered by a single comprehensive term could now
be scrapped and forgotten The greatest diculty facing the compilers of the
Newspeak Dictionary was not to invent new words but having invented them
to make sure what they meant to make sure that is to say what ranges of
words they cancelled by their existence
As we have already seen in the case of the word free words which had once
borne a heretical meaning were sometimes retained for the sake of convenience
but only with the undesirable meanings purged out of them Countless other
words such as honour justice morality internationalism democracy science
and religion had simply ceased to exist A few blanket words covered them
and in covering them abolished them All words grouping themselves round
the concepts of liberty and equality for instance were contained in the single
word crimethink while all words grouping themselves round the concepts of
objectivity and rationalism were contained in the single word oldthink Greater
precision would have been dangerous What was required in a Party member was
an outlook similar to that of the ancient Hebrew who knew without knowing
much else that all nations other than his own worshipped false gods He did
not need to know that these gods were called Baal Osiris Moloch Ashtaroth
and the like probably the less he knew about them the better for his ortho
doxy He knew Jehovah and the commandments of Jehovah he knew therefore
that all gods with other names or other attributes were false gods In some
what the same way the party member knew what constituted right conduct
and in exceedingly vague generalized terms he knew what kinds of departure
from it were possible His sexual life for example was entirely regulated by
the two Newspeak words sexcrime sexual immorality and goodsex chastity

===== Page 179 =====
Sexcrime covered all sexual misdeeds whatever It covered fornication adul
tery homosexuality and other perversions and in addition normal intercourse
practised for its own sake There was no need to enumerate them separately
since they were all equally culpable and in principle all punishable by death
In the C vocabulary which consisted of scientic and technical words it might
be necessary to give specialized names to certain sexual aberrations but the
ordinary citizen had no need of them He knew what was meant by goodsex 
that is to say normal intercourse between man and wife for the sole purpose
of begetting children and without physical pleasure on the part of the woman
all else was sexcrime In Newspeak it was seldom possible to follow a heretical
thought further than the perception that it was heretical beyond that point
the necessary words were nonexistent
No word in the B vocabulary was ideologically neutral A great many were
euphemisms Such words for instance as joycamp forcedlabour camp or
Minipax Ministry of Peace i e Ministry of War meant almost the exact
opposite of what they appeared to mean Some words on the other hand
displayed a frank and contemptuous understanding of the real nature of Oceanic
society An example was prolefeed meaning the rubbishy entertainment and
spurious news which the Party handed out to the masses Other words again
were ambivalent having the connotation good when applied to the Party and
bad when applied to its enemies But in addition there were great numbers of
words which at rst sight appeared to be mere abbreviations and which derived
their ideological colour not from their meaning but from their structure
So far as it could be contrived everything that had or might have political
signicance of any kind was tted into the B vocabulary The name of every
organization or body of people or doctrine or country or institution or public
building was invariably cut down into the familiar shape that is a single easily
pronounced word with the smallest number of syllables that would preserve the
original derivation In the Ministry of Truth for example the Records Depart
ment in which Winston Smith worked was called Recdep the Fiction Depart
ment was called Ficdep the Teleprogrammes Department was called Teledep
and so on This was not done solely with the object of saving time Even in the
early decades of the twentieth century telescoped words and phrases had been
one of the characteristic features of political language and it had been noticed
that the tendency to use abbreviations of this kind was most marked in total
itarian countries and totalitarian organizations Examples were such words as
Nazi Gestapo Comin tern Inprecorr Agitprop In the beginning the practice
had been adopted as it were instinctively but in Newspeak it was used with
a conscious purpose It was perceived that in thus abbreviating a name one
narrowed and subtly altered its meaning by cutting out most of the associa
tions that would otherwise cling to it The words Communist International for
instance call up a composite picture of universal human brotherhood red ags
barricades Karl Marx and the Paris Commune The word Comintern on the
other hand suggests merely a tightlyknit organization and a welldened body
of doctrine It refers to something almost as easily recognized and as limited
in purpose as a chair or a table Comintern is a word that can be uttered
almost without taking thought whereas Communist International is a phrase
over which one is obliged to linger at least momentarily In the same way the
associations called up by a word like Minitrue are fewer and more controllable
than those called up by Ministry of Truth This accounted not only for the

===== Page 180 =====
habit of abbreviating whenever possible but also for the almost exaggerated
care that was taken to make every word easily pronounceable
In Newspeak euphony outweighed every consideration other than exacti
tude of meaning Regularity of grammar was always sacriced to it when it
seemed necessary And rightly so since what was required above all for politi
cal purposes was short clipped words of unmistakable meaning which could be
uttered rapidly and which roused the minimum of echoes in the speakers mind
The words of the B vocabulary even gained in force from the fact that nearly
all of them were very much alike Almost invariably these words  goodthink
Minipax prolefeed sexcrime joycamp Ingsoc bellyfeel thinkpol and countless
others  were words of two or three syllables with the stress distributed equally
between the rst syllable and the last The use of them encouraged a gabbling
style of speech at once staccato and monotonous And this was exactly what
was aimed at The intention was to make speech and especially speech on any
subject not ideologically neutral as nearly as possible independent of conscious
ness For the purposes of everyday life it was no doubt necessary or sometimes
necessary to reect before speaking but a Party member called upon to make a
political or ethical judgement should be able to spray forth the correct opinions
as automatically as a machine gun spraying forth bullets His training tted
him to do this the language gave him an almost foolproof instrument and the
texture of the words with their harsh sound and a certain wilful ugliness which
was in accord with the spirit of Ingsoc assisted the process still further
So did the fact of having very few words to choose from Relative to our own
the Newspeak vocabulary was tiny and new ways of reducing it were constantly
being devised Newspeak indeed diered from most all other languages in
that its vocabulary grew smaller instead of larger every year Each reduction
was a gain since the smaller the area of choice the smaller the temptation to
take thought Ultimately it was hoped to make articulate speech issue from the
larynx without involving the higher brain centres at all This aim was frankly
admitted in the Newspeak word duckspeak meaning  to quack like a duck
Like various other words in the B vocabulary duckspeak was ambivalent in
meaning Provided that the opinions which were quacked out were orthodox
ones it implied nothing but praise and when The Times referred to one of the
orators of the Party as a doubleplusgood duckspeaker it was paying a warm and
valued compliment
The C vocabulary
The C vocabulary was supplementary to the others and consisted entirely
of scientic and technical terms These resembled the scientic terms in use
today and were constructed from the same roots but the usual care was taken
to dene them rigidly and strip them of undesirable meanings They followed
the same grammatical rules as the words in the other two vocabularies Very
few of the C words had any currency either in everyday speech or in political
speech Any scientic worker or technician could nd all the words he needed in
the list devoted to his own speciality but he seldom had more than a smattering
of the words occurring in the other lists Only a very few words were common
to all lists and there was no vocabulary expressing the function of Science as a
habit of mind or a method of thought irrespective of its particular branches
There was indeed no word for Science any meaning that it could possibly
bear being already suciently covered by the word Ingsoc
From the foregoing account it will be seen that in Newspeak the expression

===== Page 181 =====
of unorthodox opinions above a very low level was wellnigh impossible It was
of course possible to utter heresies of a very crude kind a species of blasphemy
It would have been possible for example to say Big Brother is ungood But this
statement which to an orthodox ear merely conveyed a selfevident absurdity
could not have been sustained by reasoned argument because the necessary
words were not available Ideas inimical to Ingsoc could only be entertained
in a vague wordless form and could only be named in very broad terms which
lumped together and condemned whole groups of heresies without dening them
in doing so One could in fact only use Newspeak for unorthodox purposes by
illegitimately translating some of the words back into Oldspeak For example
All mans are equal was a possible Newspeak sentence but only in the same
sense in which All men are redhaired is a possible Oldspeak sentence It did
not contain a grammatical error but it expressed a palpable untruthie that
all men are of equal size weight or strength The concept of political equality
no longer existed and this secondary meaning had accordingly been purged
out of the word equal In  when Oldspeak was still the normal means of
communication the danger theoretically existed that in using Newspeak words
one might remember their original meanings In practice it was not dicult for
any person well grounded in doublethink to avoid doing this but within a couple
of generations even the possibility of such a lapse would have vaished A person
growing up with Newspeak as his sole language would no more know that equal
had once had the secondary meaning of politically equal or that free had once
meant intellectually free than for instance a person who had never heard of
chess would be aware of the secondary meanings attaching to queen and rook
There would be many crimes and errors which it would be beyond his power
to commit simply because they were nameless and therefore unimaginable
And it was to be foreseen that with the passage of time the distinguishing
characteristics of Newspeak would become more and more pronounced  its
words growing fewer and fewer their meanings more and more rigid and the
chance of putting them to improper uses always diminishing
When Oldspeak had been once and for all superseded the last link with
the past would have been severed History had already been rewritten but
fragments of the literature of the past survived here and there imperfectly cen
sored and so long as one retained ones knowledge of Oldspeak it was possible
to read them In the future such fragments even if they chanced to survive
would be unintelligible and untranslatable It was impossible to translate any
passage of Oldspeak into Newspeak unless it either referred to some technical
process or some very simple everyday action or was already orthodox good
thinkful would be the NewsPeak expression in tendency In practice this meant
that no book written before approximately  could be translated as a whole
Prerevolutionary literature could only be subjected to ideological translation 
that is alteration in sense as well as language Take for example the wellknown
passage from the Declaration of Independence
We hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal that
they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among
these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness That to secure these rights
Governments are instituted among men deriving their powers from the consent
of the governed That whenever any form of Government becomes destructive
of those ends it is the right of the People to alter or abolish it and to institute
new Government

===== Page 182 =====
It would have been quite impossible to render this into Newspeak while
keeping to the sense of the original The nearest one could come to doing so
would be to swallow the whole passage up in the single word crimethink A full
translation could only be an ideological translation whereby Jeersons words
would be changed into a panegyric on absolute government
A good deal of the literature of the past was indeed already being trans
formed in this way Considerations of prestige made it desirable to preserve
the memory of certain historical gures while at the same time bringing their
achievements into line with the philosophy of Ingsoc Various writers such as
Shakespeare Milton Swift Byron Dickens and some others were therefore in
process of translation when the task had been completed their original writ
ings with all else that survived of the literature of the past would be destroyed
These translations were a slow and dicult business and it was not expected
that they would be nished before the rst or second decade of the twenty
rst century There were also large quantities of merely utilitarian literature
 indispensable technical manuals and the like  that had to be treated in
the same way It was chiey in order to allow time for the preliminary work
of translation that the nal adoption of Newspeak had been xed for so late a
date as
